									STEPS Eight and Nine are concerned with personal relations. First, we take a look backward and try&nbsp;to discover where we have been at fault; next we make a vigorous attempt to repair the damage we&nbsp;have done; and third, having thus cleaned away the debris of the past, we consider how, with our&nbsp;newfound knowledge of ourselves, we may develop the best possible relations with every human&nbsp;being we know.</div>
								<div>
									&nbsp;</div>
								<div id="cke_pastebin">
									This is a very large order. It is a task which we may perform with increasing skill, but never really&nbsp;finish. Learning how to live in the greatest peace, partnership, and brotherhood with all men and&nbsp;women, of whatever description, is a moving and fascinating adventure. Every A.A. has found that he&nbsp;can make little headway in this new adventure of living until he first backtracks and really makes an&nbsp;accurate and unsparing survey of the human wreckage he has left in his wake. To a degree, he has&nbsp;already done this when taking moral inventory, but now the time has come when he ought to&nbsp;redouble his efforts to see how many people he has hurt, and in what ways. This reopening of&nbsp;emotional wounds, some old, some perhaps forgotten, and some still painfully festering, will at first&nbsp;look like a purposeless and pointless piece of surgery. But if a willing</div>
								<div>
									<h2 style="text-align: right; ">

								</div>
								<div>
									start is made, then the great&nbsp;advantages of doing this will so quickly reveal themselves that the pain will be lessened as one&nbsp;obstacle after another melts away.</div>
								<div>
									&nbsp;</div>
								<div id="cke_pastebin">
									These obstacles, however, are very real. The first, and one of the most difficult, has to do with&nbsp;forgiveness. The moment we ponder a twisted or broken relationship with another person, our&nbsp;emotions go on the defensive. To escape looking at the wrongs we have done another, we resentfully&nbsp;focus on the wrong he has done us. This is especially true if he has, in fact, behaved badly at all.&nbsp;Triumphantly we seize upon his misbehavior as the perfect excuse for minimizing or forgetting our&nbsp;own.</div>
								<div>
									&nbsp;</div>
								<div id="cke_pastebin">
									Right here we need to fetch ourselves up sharply. It doesn&#39;t make much sense when a real tosspot&nbsp;calls a kettle black. Let&#39;s remember that alcoholics are not the only ones bedeviled by sick emotions.&nbsp;Moreover, it is usually a fact that our behavior when drinking has aggravated the defects of others.&nbsp;We&#39;ve repeatedly strained the patience of our best friends to a snapping point, and have brought out&nbsp;the very worst in those who didn&#39;t think much of us to begin with. In many instances we are really&nbsp;dealing with fellow sufferers, people whose woes we have increased. If we are now about to ask&nbsp;forgiveness for ourselves, why shouldn&#39;t we start out by forgiving them, one and all?</div>
								<div>
									&nbsp;</div>
								<div id="cke_pastebin">
									When listing the people we have harmed, most of us hit another solid obstacle. We got a pretty severe&nbsp;shock when we realized that we were preparing to make a face-to-face admission of our wretched&nbsp;conduct to those we had hurt. It had been embarrassing enough when in confidence we had admitted&nbsp;these things to God, to ourselves, and to</div>
								<div>
									<h2 style="text-align: right; ">
										79</h2>
								</div>
								<div>
									another human being. But the prospect of actually visiting or&nbsp;even writing the people concerned now overwhelmed us, especially when we remembered in what&nbsp;poor favor we stood with most of them. There were cases, too, where we had damaged others who&nbsp;were still happily unaware of being hurt. Why, we cried, shouldn&#39;t bygones by bygones? Why do we&nbsp;have to think of these people at all? These were some of the ways in which fear conspired with pride&nbsp;to hinder our making a list of all the people we had harmed.</div>
								<div>
									&nbsp;</div>
								<div id="cke_pastebin">
									Some of us, though, tripped over a very different snag. We clung to the claim that when drinking we&nbsp;never hurt anybody but ourselves. Our families didn&#39;t suffer, because we always paid the bills and&nbsp;seldom drank at home. Our business associates didn&#39;t suffer, because we were usually on the job. Our&nbsp;reputations hadn&#39;t suffered, because we were certain few knew of our drinking. Those who did wouldsometimes assure us that, after all, a lively bender was only a good man&#39;s fault. What real harm,&nbsp;therefore, had we done? No more, surely, than we could easily mend with a few casual apologies.</div>
								<div>
									&nbsp;</div>
								<div id="cke_pastebin">
									This attitude, of course, is the end result of purposeful forgetting. It is an attitude which can only be&nbsp;changed by a deep and honest search of our motives and actions.</div>
								<div>
									&nbsp;</div>
								<div id="cke_pastebin">
									Though in some cases we cannot make restitution at all and in some cases action ought to be&nbsp;deferred, we should nevertheless make an accurate and really exhaustive survey of our past life as it&nbsp;has affected other people. In many instances we shall find that though the harm done others has not&nbsp;been great, the emotional harm we have done ourselves has. Very deep, sometimes quite forgotten,&nbsp;damaging</div>
								<div>
									<h2 style="text-align: right; ">

								</div>
								<div>
									emotional conflicts persist below the level of consciousness. At the time of these&nbsp;occurrences, they may actually have given our emotions violent twists which have since discolored&nbsp;our personalities and altered our lives for the worse.</div>
								<div>
									&nbsp;</div>
								<div id="cke_pastebin">
									While the purpose of making restitution to others is paramount, it is equally necessary that we&nbsp;extricate from an examination of our personal relations every bit of information about ourselves and&nbsp;our fundamental difficulties that we can. Since defective relations with other human beings have&nbsp;nearly always been the immediate cause of our woes, including our alcoholism, no field of&nbsp;investigation could yield more satisfying and valuable rewards than this one. Calm, thoughtful&nbsp;reflection upon personal relations can deepen our insight. We can go far beyond those things which&nbsp;were superficially wrong with us, to see those flaws which were basic, flaws which sometimes were&nbsp;responsible for the whole patter of our lives. Thoroughness, we have found will pay - and pay&nbsp;handsomely.</div>
								<div>
									&nbsp;</div>
								<div id="cke_pastebin">
									We might next ask ourselves what we mean when we say that we have &quot;harmed&quot; other people. What&nbsp;kinds of &quot;harm&quot; do people do one another anyway? To define the word &quot;harm&quot; in a practical way, we&nbsp;might call it the result of instincts in collision, which cause physical, mental, emotional, or spiritual&nbsp;damage to people. If our tempers are consistently bad, we arouse anger in others. If we lie or cheat,&nbsp;we deprive others not only of their worldly goods, but of their emotional security and peace of mind.&nbsp;We really issue them an invitation to become contemptuous and vengeful. If our sex conduct is&nbsp;selfish, we may excite jealousy, misery, and a strong desire to retaliate in kind.</div>
								<div>
									<h2 style="text-align: right; ">
										81</h2>
								</div>
								<div id="cke_pastebin">
									Such gross misbehavior is not by any means a full catalogue of the harms we do. Let us think of some&nbsp;of the subtler ones which can sometimes be quite as damaging. Suppose that in our family lives we&nbsp;happen to be miserly, irresponsible, callous, or cold. Suppose that we are irritable, critical, impatient,&nbsp;and humorless. Suppose we lavish attention upon one member of the family and neglect the others.&nbsp;What happens when we try to dominate the whole family, either by a rule of iron or by a constant&nbsp;outpouring of minute directions for just how their lives should be lived from hour to hour? What&nbsp;happens when we wallow in depression, self-pity oozing from every pore, and inflict that upon those&nbsp;about us? Such a roster of harms done others - the kind that make daily living with us as practicing&nbsp;alcoholics difficult and often unbearable - could be extended almost indefinitely. When we take such&nbsp;personality traits as these into shop, office, and the society of our fellows, they can do damage almost&nbsp;as extensive as that we have caused at home.</div>
								<div>
									&nbsp;</div>
								<div id="cke_pastebin">
									Having carefully surveyed this whole area of human relations, and having decided exactly what&nbsp;personality traits in us injured and disturbed others, we can now commence to ransack memory for&nbsp;the people to whom we have given offense. To put a finger on the nearby and most deeply damaged&nbsp;ones shouldn&#39;t be hard to do. Then, as year by year we walk back through our lives as far as memory&nbsp;will reach, we shall be bound to construct a long list of people who have, to some extent or other, been&nbsp;affected. We should, of course, ponder and weigh each instance carefully. We shall want to hold&nbsp;ourselves to the course of</div>

								</div>
								<div>
									admitting the things we have done, meanwhile forgiving the wrongs done&nbsp;us, real or fancied. We should avoid extreme judgments, both of ourselves and of others involved. We&nbsp;must not exaggerate our defects or theirs. A quiet, objective view will be our steadfast aim.&nbsp;Whenever our pencil falters, we can fortify and cheer ourselves by remembering what A.A.&nbsp;experience in this Step has meant to others. It is the beginning of the end of isolation from our fellows&nbsp;and from God.</div>
