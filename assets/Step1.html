Every natural instinct cries out against&nbsp;the idea of personal powerlessness. It is truly awful to admit that, glass in hand, we have warped our&nbsp;minds into such an obsession for destructive drinking that only an act of Providence can remove it from us.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

Once this stark fact is accepted, our bankruptcy as going&nbsp;human concerns is complete.</span></span></div>

We perceive that&nbsp;only through utter defeat are we able to take our first steps toward liberation and strength. Our&nbsp;admissions of personal powerlessness finally turn out to be firm bedrock upon which happy and&nbsp;purposeful lives can be built.</span></span></div>

Until he so humbles himself, his sobriety - if any - will be&nbsp;precarious. Of real happiness he will find none at all. Proved beyond any doubt by an immense experience,&nbsp;this is one of the facts of A.A. life. The</span></span></div>

		<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">When first challenged to admit complete defeat, most of us revolted. We had approached A.A. expecting to&nbsp;be taught self-confidence. Then we had been told that so far as alcohol is concerned, self-confidence was&nbsp;no good whatever; in fact it was a total liability. Our sponsors declared we were the victims of a mental&nbsp;obsession so subtly powerful that no amount of human willpower could break it. There was, they said, no&nbsp;such thing as the personal conquest of this complusion by the unaided will. Relentlessly deepening our&nbsp;dilemma, our sponsors pointed out our increasing sensitivity to alcohol - an allergy, they called it. The&nbsp;tyrant alcohol wielded a double-edged sword over us: first we were smitten by an insane urge that&nbsp;condemned us to go on drinking, and then by an allergy of the body that insured we would ultimately&nbsp;destroy ourselves in the process. Few were those who, so assailed, had ever won through in singlehanded&nbsp;combat. It was a statistical fact that alcoholics almost never recovered on their own resources. And this&nbsp;had been true, apparently, ever since man had first crushed grapes.</span></span></div>

Even these &quot;last-gaspers&quot; often had difficulty in realizing how hopeless they actually were. But a&nbsp;few did, and when these laid hold of the A.A. principles with all the fervor with which the drowning seize&nbsp;life preservers, they almost invariably got well.

	<div id="cke_pastebin">
		<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">It is a tremendous satisfaction to record that in the following years this changed. Alcoholics who still had&nbsp;their health, their families, their jobs, and even two cars in the garage, began to recognize their alcoholism.&nbsp;As this trend grew, they were joined by young people who were scarely more than potential alcoholics.&nbsp;They were spared that last ten or fifteen years of literal hell the rest of us had gone through. Since Step&nbsp;One requires an admission that our lives have become unmanageable, how could people such as these take&nbsp;this Step?</span></span></div>

		<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">It was obviously necessary to raise the bottom the rest of us had hit to the point where it would hit them.&nbsp;By going back in our own drinking histories, we could show that years before we realized it we were out ofcontrol, that our drinking even then was no mere habit, that it was indeed the beginning of a fatal&nbsp;progression. To the doubters we could say, &quot;Perhaps you&#39;re not a real alcoholic after all. Why don&#39;t you try&nbsp;some more controlled drinking, bearing in mind what we have told you about alcoholism?&quot; This attitude&nbsp;brought immediate and practical results. It was then discovered that when one alcoholic had planted in&nbsp;the mind of another the true nature of his malady, that person could never be the same again. Following&nbsp;every spree, he would say to himself, &quot;Maybe those A.A.&#39;s were right.... &quot; After a few such experiences,&nbsp;often years before the onset of difficulties, he would return to us</span></span></div>

		<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Why all this insistance that every A.A. must hit bottom first? The answer is that few people will sincerely&nbsp;try to practive the A.A. program unless they have hit bottom. For practicing the A.A.&#39;s remaining eleven&nbsp;Steps means the adoption of attitudes and actions that almost no alcoholic who is still drinking can dream&nbsp;of taking. Who wishes to be rigorously honest and tolerant? Who wants to confess his faults to another and&nbsp;make restitution for harm done? Who cares anything about a Higher Power, let alone meditation and&nbsp;prayer? Who wants to sacrifice time and energy in trying to carry A.A.&#39;s message to the next sufferer? No,&nbsp;the average alcoholic, self-centered in the extreme, doesn&#39;t care for this prospect -- unless he has to do&nbsp;these things in order to stay alive himself.</span></span></div>
