														<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">THE unity of Alcoholics Anonymous is the most cherished quality our society has. Our lives, the lives&nbsp;of all to come, depend squarely upon it. We stay whole, or A.A. dies. Without unity, the heart of A.A.&nbsp;would cease to beat; our world arteries would no longer carry the life-giving grace of God; His gift to&nbsp;us would be spent aimlessly. Back again in their caves, alcoholics would reproach us and say, &quot;What a&nbsp;great thing A.A. might have been!&quot;</span></span></div>

														<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">&quot;Does this mean,&quot; some will anxiously ask, &quot;that in A.A the individual doesn&#39;t count for much? ls he to&nbsp;be dominated by his group and swallowed up in it?&nbsp;</span></span></div>

														<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">We may certainly answer this question with a loud &quot;No!&quot; We believe there isn&#39;t a fellowship on earth&nbsp;which lavishes more devoted care upon its individual members; surely there is none which more&nbsp;jealously guards the individual&#39;s right to think, talk, and act as he wishes. No A.A. can compel another&nbsp;to do anything; nobody can be punished or expelled. Our Twelve Steps to recovery are suggestions;&nbsp;the Twelve Traditions which guarantee A.A.&#39;s unity contain not a single &quot;Don&#39;t.&quot; They repeatedly say&nbsp;&quot;We ought...&quot; but never &quot;You must!&quot;</span></span></div>

														<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">A A. for the first time is greatly puzzled. They see liberty verging on license, yet they&nbsp;recognize at once that A.A. has an irresistible strength of purpose and action. &quot;How,&quot; they ask, &quot;can&nbsp;such a crowd of anarchists function at all? How can they possibly place their common welfare first?&nbsp;What In Heaven&#39;s name holds them together?&quot;</span></span></div>

														&nbsp;</div>
													<div id="cke_pastebin">
														<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Those who look closely soon have the key to this strange paradox. The A.A. member has to conform&nbsp;to the principles of recovery. His life actually depends upon obedience to spiritual principles. lf he&nbsp;deviates too far, the penalty is sure and swift; he sickens and dies. At first he goes along because he&nbsp;must, but later he discovers a way of life he really wants to live. Moreover, he finds he cannot keep&nbsp;this priceless gift unless he gives it away. Neither he nor anybody else can survive unless he carries&nbsp;the A.A. message. The moment this Twelfth Step work forms a group, another discovery is made --&nbsp;that most individuals cannot recover unless there is a group. Realization dawns that he is but a small&nbsp;part of a great whole; that no personal sacrifice is too great for preservation of the Fellowship. He&nbsp;learns that the clamor of desires and ambitions within him must be silenced whenever these could&nbsp;damage the group. It becomes plain that the group must survive or the individual will not.</span></span></div>

														<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">So at the outset, how best to live and work together as groups became the prime question. In the&nbsp;world about us we saw personalities destroying whole peoples. The struggle for wealth, power, and&nbsp;prestige was tearing humanity apart as never before. If strong people were stalemated in the search&nbsp;for peace and harmony what was to become of our erratic band of alcoholics? As we had once&nbsp;struggled and </span></span></div>

														<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">prayed for individual recovery, just so earnestly did we commence to quest for the&nbsp;principles through which A.A. itself might survive. On anvils of experience, the structure of our&nbsp;Society was hammered out.</span></span></div>

													<div id="cke_pastebin">
														<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Countless times, ln as many cities and hamlets, we reenacted the story of Eddie Rlckenbacker and his&nbsp;courageous company when their plane crashed in the Pacific. Like us, they had suddenly found&nbsp;themselves saved from death, but still floating upon a perilous sea. How well they saw that their&nbsp;common welfare came first. None might become selfish of water or bread. Each needed to consider&nbsp;the others, and in abiding faith they knew they must find their real strength. And this they did find, inmeasure to transcend all the defects of their frail craft, every test of uncertainty, pain, fear, and&nbsp;despair, and even the death of one.</span></span></div>

														<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Thus has it been with A.A. By faith and by works we have been able to build upon the lessons of an&nbsp;incredible experience. They live today in the Twelve Traditions of Alcoholics Anonymous, which --&nbsp;God willing -- shall sustain us in unity for so long as He may need us.</span></span></div>
