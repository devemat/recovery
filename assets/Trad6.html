				<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">THE moment we saw that we had an answer for alcoholism, it was reasonable (or so it seemed at the&nbsp;time) for us to feel that we might have the answer to a lot of other things. The A.A. groups, many&nbsp;thought, could go into business, might finance any enterprise whatever in the total field of alcoholism.&nbsp;In fact, we felt duty-bound to throw the whole weight of the A.A. name behind any meritorious cause.</span></span></div>

				<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Here are some of the things we dreamed. Hospitals didn&#39;t like alcoholics, so we thought we&#39;d build a&nbsp;hospital chain of our own. People needed to be told what alcoholism was, so we&#39;d educate the public,&nbsp;even rewrite school and medical textbooks. We&#39;d gather up derelicts from skid rows, sort out those&nbsp;who could get well, and make it possible for the rest to earn their livelihood in a kind of quarantined&nbsp;confinement. Maybe these places would make large sums of money to carry on our other good works.&nbsp;We seriously thought of rewriting the laws of the land, and having it declared the alcoholics are sick&nbsp;people. No more would they be jailed; judges would parole them in our custody. We&#39;d spill A.A. into&nbsp;the dark regions of dope addiction and </span></span></div>

We&#39;d form groups of depressive and paranoid folks;&nbsp;the deeper the neurosis, the better we&#39;d like it. It stood to reason that if alcoholism could be licked, so&nbsp;could any problem.</span></span></div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
			<div id="cke_pastebin">
				<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">It occurred to us that we could take what we had into the factories and cause laborers and capitalists&nbsp;to love each other. Our uncompromising honesty might soon clean up politics. With one arm around&nbsp;the shoulder of religion and the other around the shoulder of medicine, we&#39;d resolve their differences.&nbsp;Having learned to live so happily, we&#39;d show everybody else how. Why, we thought, our Society of&nbsp;Alcoholics Anonymous might prove to be the spearhead of a new spiritual advance! We might&nbsp;transform the world.</span></span></div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
			<div id="cke_pastebin">
				<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Yes, we of A.A. did dream those dreams. How natural that was, since most alcoholics are bankrupt&nbsp;idealists. Nearly every one of us had wished to do great good, perform great deeds, and embody great&nbsp;ideals. We are all perfectionists who, failing perfection, have gone to the other extreme and settled for&nbsp;the bottle and the blackout. Providence, through A.A., had brought us within reach of our highest&nbsp;expectations. So why shouldn&#39;t we share our way of life with everyone?</span></span></div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
			<div id="cke_pastebin">
				<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Whereupon we tried A.A. hospitals--they all bogged down because you cannot put an A.A. group into&nbsp;business; too many busybody cooks spoil the broth. A.A. groups had their fling at education, and when&nbsp;they began to publicly whoop up the merits of this or that brand, people became confused. Did A.A. fix&nbsp;drunks or was it an educational project? Was A.A. spiritual or was it medical? Was it a reform&nbsp;movement? In consternation, we saw ourselves get- </span></span></div>

				<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">ting married to all kinds of enterprises, some good&nbsp;and some not so good. Watching alcoholics committed willy-nilly to prisons or asylums, we began to&nbsp;cry, &quot;There oughtta be a law!&quot; A.A.&#39;s commenced to thump tables in legislative committee rooms and&nbsp;agitated for legal reform. That made good newspaper copy, but little else. We saw we&#39;d soon be mired&nbsp;in politics. Even inside A.A. we found it imperative to remove the A.A. name from clubs and Twelfth&nbsp;Step houses.</span></span></div>

				&nbsp;</div>
			<div id="cke_pastebin">
				<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">These adventures implanted a deep-rooted conviction that in no circumstances could we endorse any&nbsp;related enterprise, no matter how good. We of Alcoholics Anonymous could not be all things to all&nbsp;men, nor should we try.</span></span></div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
				<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Years ago this principle of &quot;no endorsement&quot; was put to a vital test. Some of the great distilling&nbsp;companies proposed to go into the field of alcohol education. It would be a good thing, they believed,&nbsp;for the liquor trade to show a sense of public responsibility. They wanted to say that liquor should be&nbsp;enjoyed, not misused; hard drinkers ought to slow down, and problem drinkers--alcoholics--should&nbsp;not drink at all.</span></span></div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
			<div id="cke_pastebin">
				<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">In one of their trade associations, the question arose of just how this campaign should be handled. Of&nbsp;course, they would use the resources of radio, press, and films to make their point. But what kind of&nbsp;person should head the job? They immediately thought of Alcoholics Anonymous. If they could find a&nbsp;good public relations man in our ranks, why wouldn&#39;t he be ideal? He&#39;d certainly know the problem.&nbsp;His connection with A.A. would be valuable, because the Fellowship stood high in public favor and&nbsp;hadn&#39;t an enemy in the world.</span></span></div>

Straightaway he appeared at&nbsp;New York&#39;s A.A. headquarters, asking, &quot;Is there anything in our tradition that suggests I shouldn&#39;t&nbsp;take a job like this one? The kind of education seems good to me, and is not too controversial. Do you&nbsp;headquarters folks see any bugs in it?&quot;</span></span></div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
			<div id="cke_pastebin">
				<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">At first glance, it did look like a good thing. Then doubt crept in. The association wanted to use our&nbsp;member&#39;s full name in all its advertising; he was to be described both as its director of publicity and as&nbsp;a member of Alcoholics Anonymous. Of course, there couldn&#39;t be the slightest objection if such an&nbsp;association hired an A.A. member solely because of his public relations ability and his knowledge of&nbsp;alcoholism. But that wasn&#39;t the whole story, for in this case not only was an A.A. member to break his&nbsp;anonymity at a public level, he was to link the name Alcoholics Anonymous to this particular&nbsp;educational project in the minds of millions. It would be bound to appear that A.A. was now backing&nbsp;education--liquor trade association style.</span></span></div>

				&nbsp;</div>
			<div id="cke_pastebin">
				<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">The minute we saw this compromising fact for what it was, we asked the prospective publicity&nbsp;director how he felt about it. &quot;Great guns!&quot; he said. &quot;Of course I can&#39;t take the job. The ink wouldn&#39;t&nbsp;be dry on the first ad before an awful shriek would go up from the dry camp. They&#39;d be out with&nbsp;lanterns looking for an honest A.A. to plump for their brand of education. A.A. would land exactly in&nbsp;the middle of the wet-dry controversy. Half the people in this country would think we&#39;d signed up&nbsp;with the drys, the other half would think we&#39;d joined the wets. What a mess!&quot;</span></span></div>
