								<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Since this Step so specifically concerns itself&nbsp;with humility, we should pause here to consider what humility is and what the practice of it can mean&nbsp;to us.</span></span></div>
							<div>
								&nbsp;</div>
							<div id="cke_pastebin">
								<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Indeed, the attainment of greater humility is the foundation principle of each of A.A.&#39;s Twelve Steps.&nbsp;For without some degree of humility, no alcoholic can stay sober at all. Nearly all A.A.&#39;s have found,&nbsp;too, that unless they develop much more of this precious quality than may be required just for&nbsp;sobriety, they still haven&#39;t much chance of becoming truly happy. Without it, they cannot live to much&nbsp;useful purpose, or, in adversity, be able to summon the faith that can meet any emergency.</span></span></div>
							<div>
								&nbsp;</div>
							<div id="cke_pastebin">
								<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Humility, as a word and as an ideal, has a very bad time of it in our world. Not only is the idea&nbsp;misunderstood; the word itself is often intensely disliked. Many people haven&#39;t even a nodding&nbsp;acquaintance with humility as a way of life. Much of the everyday talk we hear, and a great deal of&nbsp;what we read, highlights man&#39;s pride in his own achievements.&nbsp;</span></span></div>
							<div>
								&nbsp;</div>
							<div>
								<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">With great intelligence, men of science have been forcing nature to disclose her secrets. The immense&nbsp;resources now being harnessed promise such a quantity of material blessings that many have come to&nbsp;believe that a man-made millennium lies just ahead. Poverty will disappear, and there </span></span></div>

								<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">will be such&nbsp;abundance that everybody can have all the security and personal satisfactions he desires. The theory&nbsp;seems to be that once everybody&#39;s primary instincts are satisfied, there won&#39;t be much left to quarrel&nbsp;about. The world will then turn happy and be free to concentrate on culture and character. Solely by&nbsp;their own intelligence and labor, men will have shaped their own destiny.</span></span></div>
							<div>
								&nbsp;</div>
							<div id="cke_pastebin">
								<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Certainly no alcoholic, and surely no member of A.A., wants to deprecate material achievement. Nor&nbsp;do we enter into debate with the many who still so passionately cling to the belief that to satisfy our&nbsp;basic natural desires is the main object of life. But we are sure that no class of people in the world&nbsp;ever made a worse mess of trying to live by this formula than alcoholics. For thousands of years we&nbsp;have been demanding more than our share of security, prestige, and romance. When we seemed to&nbsp;be succeeding, we drank to dream still greater dreams. When we were frustrated, even in part, we&nbsp;drank for oblivion. Never was there enough of what we thought we wanted.</span></span></div>
							<div>
								&nbsp;</div>
							<div id="cke_pastebin">
								<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">In all these strivings, so many of them well-intentioned, our crippling handicap had been our lack of&nbsp;humility. We had lacked the perspective to see that character-building and spiritual values had to&nbsp;come first, and that material satisfactions were not the purpose of living. Quite characteristically, we&nbsp;had gone all out in confusing the ends with the means. Instead of regarding the satisfaction of our&nbsp;material desires as the means by which we could live and function as human beings, we had taken&nbsp;these satisfactions to be the final end and aim of life.</span></span></div>
							<div>
								&nbsp;</div>
							<div id="cke_pastebin">
								<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">True, most of us thought good character was desirable, </span></span></div>

							</div>
							<div>
								<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">but obviously good character was something&nbsp;one needed to get on with the business of being self-satisfied. With a proper display of honesty and&nbsp;morality, we&#39;d stand a better chance of getting what we really wanted. But whenever we had to&nbsp;choose between character and comfort, the character-building was lost in the dust of our chase after&nbsp;what we thought was happiness. Seldom did we look at character-building as something desirable in&nbsp;itself, something we would like to strive for whether our instinctual needs were met or not. We never&nbsp;thought of making honesty, tolerance, and true love of man and God the daily basis of living.</span></span></div>
							<div>
								&nbsp;</div>
							<div>
								<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">This lack of anchorage to any permanent values, this blindness to the true purpose of our lives,&nbsp;produced another bad result. For just as long as we were convinced that we could live exclusively by&nbsp;our own individual strength and intelligence, for just that long was a working faith in a Higher Power&nbsp;impossible. This was true even when we believed that God existed. We could actually have earnest&nbsp;religious beliefs which remained barren because we were still trying to play God ourselves. As long as&nbsp;we placed self-reliance first, a genuine reliance upon a Higher Power was out of the question. That&nbsp;basic ingredient of all humility, a desire to seek and do God&#39;s will, was missing.</span></span></div>
							<div>
								&nbsp;</div>
							<div id="cke_pastebin">
								<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">For us, the process of gaining a new perspective was unbelievably painful. It was only by repeated&nbsp;humiliations that we were forced to learn something about humility. It was only at the end of a long&nbsp;road, marked by successive defeats and humiliations, and the final crushing of our self-sufficiency,&nbsp;that we began to feel humility as something more than a condition of groveling despair. Every&nbsp;newcomer in </span></span></div>

								<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Alcoholics Anonymous is told, and soon realizes for himself, that his humble admission of&nbsp;powerlessness over alcohol is his first step toward liberation from its paralyzing grip.</span></span></div>
							<div>
								&nbsp;</div>
							<div>
								<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">So it is that we first see humility as a necessity. But this is the barest beginning. To get completely&nbsp;away from our aversion to the idea of being humble, to gain a vision of humility as the avenue to true&nbsp;freedom of the human spirit, to be willing to work for humility as something to be desired for itself,&nbsp;takes most of us a long, long time. A whole lifetime geared to self-centeredness cannot be set in&nbsp;reverse all at once. Rebellion dogs our every step at first.&nbsp;</span></span></div>
							<div>
								&nbsp;</div>
							<div>
								<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">When we have finally admitted without reservation that we are powerless over alcohol, we are apt to&nbsp;breathe a great sigh of relief, saying, &quot;Well thank God that&#39;s over! I&#39;ll never have to go through that&nbsp;again!&quot; Then we learn, often to our consternation, that this is only the first milestone on the new road&nbsp;we are walking. Still goaded by sheer necessity, we reluctantly come to grips with those serious&nbsp;character flaws that made problem drinkers of us in the first place, flaws which must be dealt with to&nbsp;prevent a retreat into alcoholism once again. We still want to be rid of some of these defects, but in&nbsp;some instances this will appear to be an impossible job from which we recoil. And we cling with a&nbsp;passionate persistence to others which are just as disturbing to our equilibrium, because we still enjoy&nbsp;them too much. How can we possibly summon the resolution and the willingness to get rid of such&nbsp;overwhelming compulsions and desires?</span></span></div>
							<div>
								&nbsp;</div>
							<div id="cke_pastebin">
								<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">But again we are driven on by the inescapable conclusion which we draw from A.A. experience, that&nbsp;we surely must </span></span></div>

							<div>
								<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">try with a will, or else fall by the wayside. At this stage of our progress we are under&nbsp;heavy pressure and coercion to do the right thing. We are obliged to choose between the pains of&nbsp;trying and the certain penalties of failing to do so. These initial steps along the road are taken&nbsp;grudgingly, yet we do take them. We may still have no very high opinion of humility as a desirable&nbsp;personal virtue, but we do recognize it as a necessary aid to our survival.</span></span></div>
							<div>
								&nbsp;</div>
							<div id="cke_pastebin">
								<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">But when we have taken a square look at some of these defects, have discussed them with another,&nbsp;and have become willing to have them removed, our thinking about humility commences to have&nbsp;wider meaning. By this time in all probability we have gained some measure of release from our more&nbsp;devastating handicaps. We enjoy moments in which there is something like real peace of mind. To&nbsp;those of us who have hitherto known only excitement, depression, or anxiety -in other words, to all of&nbsp;us- this newfound peace is a priceless gift. Something new indeed has been added. Where humility&nbsp;had formerly stood for a forced feeding on humble pie, it now begins to mean the nourishing&nbsp;ingredient which can give us serenity.</span></span></div>
							<div>
								&nbsp;</div>
							<div id="cke_pastebin">
								<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">This improved perception of humility starts another revolutionary change in our outlook. Our eyes&nbsp;begin to open to the immense values which have come straight out of painful ego-puncturing. Until&nbsp;now, our lives have been largely devoted to running from pain and problems. We fled from them as&nbsp;from a plague. We never wanted to deal with the fact of suffering. Escape via the bottle was always&nbsp;our solution. Character-building through suffering might be all right for saints, but it certainly didn&#39;t&nbsp;appeal to us.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

							</div>
							<div id="cke_pastebin">
								<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Then, in A.A., we looked and listened. Everywhere we saw failure and misery transformed by&nbsp;humility into priceless assets. We heard story after story of how humility had brought strength out ofweakness. In every case, pain had been the price of admission into a new life. But this admission price&nbsp;had purchased more than we expected. It brought a measure of humility, which we soon discovered&nbsp;to be a healer of pain. We began to fear pain less, and desire humility more than ever.&nbsp;</span></span></div>
							<div>
								&nbsp;</div>
							<div>
								<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">During this process of learning more about humility, the most profound result of all was the change in&nbsp;our attitude toward God. And this was true whether we had been believers or unbelievers. We began&nbsp;to get over the idea that the Higher Power was a sort of bush-league pinch hitter, to be called upon&nbsp;only in an emergency. The notion that we would still live our own lives, God helping a little now and&nbsp;then, began to evaporate. Many of us who had thought ourselves religious awoke to the limitations of&nbsp;this attitude. Refusing to place God first, we had deprived ourselves of His help. But now the words&nbsp;&quot;Of myself I am nothing, the Father doeth the works&quot; began to carry bright promise and meaning.</span></span></div>
							<div>
								&nbsp;</div>
							<div id="cke_pastebin">
								<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">We saw we needn&#39;t always be bludgeoned and beaten into humility. It could come quite as much from&nbsp;our voluntary reaching for it as it could from unremitting suffering. A great turning point in our lives&nbsp;came when we sought for humility as something we really wanted, rather than as something we must&nbsp;have. It marked the time when we could commence to see the full implication of Step Seven:&nbsp;&quot;Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.&quot;&nbsp;</span></span></div>

							<div id="cke_pastebin">
								<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">As we approach the actual taking of Step Seven, it might be well if we A.A.&#39;s inquire once more just&nbsp;what our deeper objectives are. Each of us would like to live at peace with himself and with his&nbsp;fellows. We would like to be assured that the grace of God can do for us what we cannot do for&nbsp;ourselves. We have seen that character defects based upon shortsighted or unworthy desires are the&nbsp;obstacles that block our path toward these objectives. We now clearly see that we have been making&nbsp;unreasonable demands upon our selves, upon others, and upon God.</span></span></div>
							<div>
								&nbsp;</div>
							<div id="cke_pastebin">
								<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">The chief activator of our defects has been self-centered fear--primarily fear that we would lose&nbsp;something we already possessed or would fail to get something we demanded. Living upon a basis of&nbsp;unsatisfied demands, we were in a state of continual disturbance and frustration. Therefore, no peace&nbsp;was to be had unless we could find a means of reducing these demands. The difference between a&nbsp;demand and a simple request is plain to anyone.</span></span></div>
							<div>
								&nbsp;</div>
							<div id="cke_pastebin">
								<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">The Seventh Step is where we make the change in our attitude which permits us, with humility as&nbsp;our guide, to move out from ourselves toward others and toward God. The whole emphasis of Step&nbsp;Seven is on humility. It is really saying to us that we now ought to be willing to try humility in seeking&nbsp;the removal of our other shortcomings just as we did when we admitted that we were powerless over&nbsp;alcohol, and came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity. If that&nbsp;degree of humility could enable us to find the grace by which such a deadly obsession could be&nbsp;banished, then there must be hope of the same result respecting any other problem we could possibly&nbsp;have.&nbsp;</span></span></div>
