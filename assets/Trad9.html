							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">WHEN Tradition Nine was first written, it said that &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous needs the least possible&nbsp;organization.&quot; In years since then, we have changed our minds about that. Today, we are able to say&nbsp;with assurance that Alcoholics Anonymous -A.A. as a whole--should never be organized at all. Then,&nbsp;in seeming contradiction, we proceed to create special service boards and committees which in&nbsp;themselves are organized. How, then, can we have an unorganized movement which can and does&nbsp;create a sevice organization for itself? Scanning this puzzler, people say, &quot;What do they mean, no&nbsp;organization.&quot;</span></span></div>

							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Well, let&sup1;s see. Did anyone ever hear of a nation, a church, a political party, even a benevolent&nbsp;association that had no membership rules? Did anyone ever hear of a society which couldn&sup1;t&nbsp;somehow discipline its members and enforce obedience to necessary rules and regulations? Doesn&sup1;t&nbsp;nearly every society on earth give authority to some of it&sup1;s members to impose obedience upon the&nbsp;rest and to punish or expell offenders? Therefore, every nation, in fact every form of society, has to&nbsp;be a government administered by human beings, Power to direct or govern is the essence of&nbsp;organization everywhere.</span></span></div>

							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Yet Alcoholics Anonymous is an exception. It does not conform to this pattern. Neither its General&nbsp;Service Confer- ence, its Foundation Board,* nor the humbelest group com- mittee can issue a single&nbsp;directive to an A.A. member and make it stick, let alone mete out any punishment. We&sup1;ve tried it lots&nbsp;of times, but utter failure is always the result. Groups have tried to expel members, but the banished&nbsp;have come back to sit in te meeting place, saying &quot;This is life for us; you can&sup1;t keep us out;&quot;&nbsp;Committees have instructed many an A.A. to stop working on a chronic backslider, only to be told:&nbsp;&quot;How I do my Twelfth Step work is my business. Who are you to judge?&quot; This doesn&#39;t mean an A.A.&nbsp;won&sup1;t take advice or suggestions from more experienced members, but he surely won&sup1;t take orders.&nbsp;Who is more unpopular than the oldtime A.A., full of wisdom, who moves to an- other area and tries&nbsp;to tell the group there how to run its business? He and all like him who &quot;view with alarm for the good&nbsp;of A.A.&quot; meet the most stubborn resistance or, worse still, laughter.</span></span></div>

							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">You might think A.A.&#39;s headquarters in New York would be an exception. Surely, the people there&nbsp;would have to have some authority. But long ago, trustees and staff members alike found they could&nbsp;do no more than make suggestions, and very mild ones at that. They even had to coin a couple&nbsp;sentences which still go into half the letters they write: &quot;Of course, you are at perfect liberty to&nbsp;handle this matter any way you please. But the majority experi-</span></span></div>

							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">ence in A.A. does seem to&nbsp;suggest...&quot;Now, that attitude is far more removed from central government, isn&#39;t it? We recognize&nbsp;that alcoholics can&#39;t be dictated to---individually or collectively.</span></span></div>

						<div id="cke_pastebin">
							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">At this juncture, we can hear a churchman exclaim, &quot;They are making disobedience a virtue.&quot; He is&nbsp;joined by a psychiatrist who says, &quot;Defiant brats!&quot; They won&sup1;t grow up and conform to social usage!&sup2;&nbsp;The man in the street says, &quot;I don&sup1;t understand it. They must be nuts!&quot; But all these observers have&nbsp;overlooked something unique in Alcoholics Anonymous. Unless each A.A. member follows to the best&nbsp;of his ability our suggested Twelve Steps to recovery, he almost certainly signs his own death warrant. His drunkenness and dissolution are not penalties in- flicted by people in authority; they result&nbsp;from his personal disobedience to spiritual principles.The same stern threat applies to the group itself. Unless there is approximate conformity to A.A.&#39;s&nbsp;Twelve Traditions, the group, too, can deteriorate and die. So we of A.A. do obey spiritual principles,&nbsp;first because we must, and ultimately because we love the kind of life such obedience brings. Great&nbsp;suffering and great love are disciplinarians; we need no others.</span></span></div>

							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">It is clear now that we ought never to name boards to govern us, but it is equally clear that we shall&nbsp;always need to authorize workers to serve us. It is the difference between the spirit of vested&nbsp;authority and the spirit of service, two concepts which are sometimes poles apart. It is in this spirit of&nbsp;service that we elect the A.A. group&#39;s informal rotating committee, the intergroup assocation for the&nbsp;area, and the </span></span></div>

							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">General Service Conferences of Alcoholics Anonymous for A.A. as a whole. Even our&nbsp;Foundation, once an independent board, is today directly accountable to our Fellowship. Its trustees&nbsp;are the caretakers and expediters of our world service.</span></span></div>

							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Just as the aim of each A.A. member is personal sobriety, the aim of our services is to bring sobriety&nbsp;within reach of all who want it. If nobody does the group&sup1;s chores, if the area&#39;s telephone rings&nbsp;unanswered, if we do not reply to our mail, then A.A. as we know it would stop. Our communications&nbsp;lines with those who need our help would be broken.</span></span></div>

							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">A.A. has to function, but at the same time it must avoid those dangers of great wealth, prestige, and&nbsp;entrenched power which ecessarily tempt other societies. Though Tradition Nine at first sight seems&nbsp;to deal with a purely practical matter, in its actual operation it discloses a society without&nbsp;organization, animated only by the spirit of service--a true fellowship.&nbsp;</span></span></div>
