			<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">THE moment they read Step Two, most A.A. newcomers are confronted with the dilemma,&nbsp;sometimes a serious one. How often have we heard them cry out, &quot;Look what you people have done&nbsp;to us! You have convinced us that we are alcoholics and that our lives are unmanageable. Having&nbsp;reduced us to a state of absolute helplessness, you now declare that none but a Higher Power can&nbsp;remove our obsession. Some won&#39;t believe in God, others can&#39;t, and still others who do believe that&nbsp;God exists have no faith whatever that he will preform this miracle. Yes, you&#39;ve got us over the&nbsp;barrel, all right - but where do we go from here?&quot;</span></span></div>

		<div id="cke_pastebin">
			<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Lets look first at the case of the one who says he won&#39;t believe - the belligerent one. He is in a state of&nbsp;mind which can only be described as savage. His whole philosophy of life, in which he so gloried, is&nbsp;threatened. It&#39;s bad enough, he thinks, to admit alcohol has him down for keeps. But now still&nbsp;smarting from that admission, he is faced with something really impossible. How does he cherish the&nbsp;thought that man, risen so majestically from a single cell in the primordial ooze, is the spearhead of&nbsp;evolution and therefore the only God that his universe knows! Must he renounce all this to save&nbsp;himself?</span></span></div>

			<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">At this juncture his A.A. sponsor usually laughs. This, the newcomer thinks, is just about the last&nbsp;straw. This is the beginning of the end. And so it is: the beginning of the end of his old life and the&nbsp;beginning of his emergence into a new one. His sponsor usally says, &quot;Take it easy. The hoop you have&nbsp;to jump through is a lot wider than you think. At least I&#39;ve found it so. So did a friend of mine who was&nbsp;a one time vice-president of the American Atheist Society, but he got through with room to spare.&quot;</span></span></div>

		<div id="cke_pastebin">
			<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">&quot;Well,&quot; says the newcomer, &quot;I know you&#39;re telling me the truth. It&#39;s no doubt a fact that A.A. is full of&nbsp;people who once believed as I do. But just how, in these circumstances, does a fellow &#39;take it easy&#39;?&nbsp;That&#39;s what I want to know.&quot;</span></span></div>

			&nbsp;</div>
		<div id="cke_pastebin">
			<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">&quot;That,&quot; agrees the sponsor, &quot;is a very good question indeed. I think I can tell you exactly how to&nbsp;relax. You won&#39;t have to work at it very hard, either. Listen, if you will, to these three statements.&nbsp;First, Alcoholics Anonymous does not demand that you believe anything. All of its Twelve Steps are&nbsp;but suggestions. Second to get sober and stay sober, you don&#39;t have to swallow all of Step Two right&nbsp;now. Looking back, I find that I took it piecemeal myself. Third, all you really need is a truly open&nbsp;mind. Just resign from the debating society and quit bothering yourself with such deep questions as&nbsp;whether it was the hen or the egg that came first. Again I say, all you need is the open mind.&quot;</span></span></div>

			<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">The sponsor continues, &quot;Take, for example, my own experience. I had a scientific schooling.

		<div id="cke_pastebin">
			<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">&quot;Then I woke up. I had to admit that A.A. showed results, prodigious results. I saw that my attitude&nbsp;had been anything but scientific. It wasn&#39;t A.A. that had the closed mind, it was me. The minute I&nbsp;stopped arguing, I could begin to see and feel. Right there, Step Two gently and very gradually began&nbsp;to infiltrate my life. I can&#39;t say upon what occasion or upon what date I came to believe in a Powergreater than myself, but I certainly have that belief now. To acquire it, I had only to stop fighting and&nbsp;practice the rest of A.A.&#39;s program as enthusiastically as I could.&quot;</span></span></div>

If you don&#39;t care for the one I&#39;ve suggested,&nbsp;you&#39;ll be sure to discover one that suits if only you look and listen. Many a man like you has begun to&nbsp;solve the problem by the method of substitution. You can, if you wish, make A.A. itself your &#39;Higher&nbsp;Power.&#39; Here&#39;s a very large group of people who have solved their alcohol problem. In this respect&nbsp;they are certainly a power greater than you, who have not even come close to a solution. Surely you&nbsp;can have faith in them. Even this minimum of faith will be enough. You will find many members that&nbsp;have crossed the threshold just this way. All of them will tell you that, once across, their faith&nbsp;broadened </span></span></div>

Relieved of the alcohol obsession, their lives unaccountably transformed,&nbsp;they came to believe in a Higher Power, and most of them began to talk of God.&quot;&nbsp;</span></span></div>

			<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Consider next the plight of those who once had faith, but have lost it. There will be those who have&nbsp;drifted into indifference, those filled with self-sufficiency who have cut themselves off, those who&nbsp;have become prejudiced against religion, and those who are downright defiant because God has failed&nbsp;to fulfill their demands. Can A.A. experience tell all these they may find a faith that works?&nbsp;</span></span></div>
		<div>
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Sometimes A.A. comes harder to those who have lost or rejected faith than to those who never had&nbsp;any faith at all, for they think they have tried faith and found it wanting. They have tried the way of&nbsp;faith and the way of no faith. Since both ways proved bitterly disappointing, they have concluded&nbsp;there is no place whatever for them to go. The roadblocks of indifference, fancied self-sufficiency,&nbsp;prejudice, and defiance often prove more solid and formidable for these people than any erected by&nbsp;the unconvinced agnostic or even the militant atheist. Religion says the existance of God can be&nbsp;proved; the agnostic says it can&#39;t be proved; the atheist claims proof of the nonexistence of God.&nbsp;Obviously, the dilemma of the wanderer from faith is that of profound confusion. He thinks himself&nbsp;lost to the comfort of any conviction at all. He cannot attain in even a small degree the assurance of&nbsp;the believer, the agnostic, or the atheist. He is the bewildered one.</span></span></div>

We were still sure that we ought to be fairly honest, tolerant, and&nbsp;just, that we ought to be ambitious and hardworking. We became convinced that such simple rules of&nbsp;fair play and decency would be enough.</span></span></div>

		<div id="cke_pastebin">
			<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">&quot;As material success founded upon no more than these ordinary attributes began to come to us we&nbsp;felt that we were winning at the game of life. This was exhilarating, and it made us happy. Why&nbsp;should we be bothered with theological abstractions and religious duties, or with the state of our souls&nbsp;here or hereafter? The here and now was good enough for us. The will to win would carry us through.&nbsp;Finally when all our score cards read &#39;zero,&#39; and we saw that one more strike would put us out of the&nbsp;game forever, we had to look for our lost faith. It was in A.A. that we rediscovered it. And so can you.</span></span></div>

To these,&nbsp;many of A.A.&#39;s can say, &quot;Yes, we were like you -- far too smart for our own good. We loved to have&nbsp;people call us precocious. We used our education to blow ourselves up into prideful balloons, though&nbsp;we were careful to hide this from others. Secretly, we felt we could float above the rest of the folks on&nbsp;our brainpower alone. Scientific progress told us us there was nothing man couldn&#39;t do. Knowledge&nbsp;was all powerful. Intellect could conquer nature. Since we were brighter than most folks (or so we&nbsp;thought), the spoils of victory would be ours for the thinking. The god of intellect displaced the God of&nbsp;our fathers. But again John Barleycorn had other </span></span></div>

We saw that we had to reconsider or die. We found many in A.A. who once&nbsp;thought as we did. They helped us get down to our right size. By their example they showed us that&nbsp;humility and intellect could be compatible, provided we placed humility first. When we began to do&nbsp;that, we received the gift of faith, a faith which works. This faith is for you too.&quot;</span></span></div>

			<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Another crowd of A.A.&#39;s says: &quot;We were plumb disgusted with religion and all its works. The Bible, wesaid, was full of nonsense; we could cite it chapter and verse, and we couldn&#39;t see the Beatitudes for&nbsp;the &#39;begats.&#39; In spots its morality was impossibly good; in others it seemed impossibly bad. But it was&nbsp;the morality of the religionists themselves that really got us down. We gloated over their hypocrisy,&nbsp;bigotry, and crushing self-rightousness that clung to so many &#39;believers&#39; even in their Sunday best.&nbsp;How we loved to shout the damaging fact that millions of the &#39;good men of religion&#39; were still killing&nbsp;one another off in the name of God. This all meant, of course, that we had substituted negative&nbsp;thinking for positive thinking. After we came to A.A., we had to recognize that this trait had been an&nbsp;ego-feeding proposition. In belaboring the sins of some religious people, we could feel superior to all of&nbsp;them. Moreover, we could avoid looking at some of our own shortcomings. Self-rightousness, the very&nbsp;thing we contemptously condemned in others, was our own besetting evil. This phoney form of&nbsp;respectibility was our undoing, so far as faith was concerned. But finally, driven to A.A., we learned&nbsp;better.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

			<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">As psychiatrists have often observed, defiance is the outstanding characteristic of many an alcoholic.&nbsp;So it&#39;s not strange that lots of us have had our day at defying God Himself. Sometimes it&#39;s because&nbsp;God has not delivered us the good things of life which we specified, as a greedy child makes a list for&nbsp;Santa Claus. More often, though, we had met up with some major calamity, and to our way of&nbsp;thinking lost out because God deserted us. The girl we wanted to marry had other notions; we prayed&nbsp;God that she&#39;d change her mind, but she didn&#39;t. We prayed for healthy children and were presented&nbsp;with sick ones, or none at all. We prayed for promotions at business and none came. Loved ones, upon&nbsp;whom we heartily depended, were taken from us by so called acts of God. Then we became&nbsp;drunkards and asked God to stop that. But nothing happened. This was the unkindest cut of all.&nbsp;&#39;Damn this faith business!&#39; we said.</span></span></div>

			<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">&quot;When we encountered A.A., the fallacy of our defiance was revealed. At no time had we asked what&nbsp;God&#39;s will was for us; instead we had been telling Him what it ought to be. No man, we saw, could&nbsp;believe in God and defy Him, too. Belief meant reliance, not defiance. In A.A. we saw the fruits of this&nbsp;belief: men and women spared from alcohol&#39;s final castrophe. We saw them meet and transcend their&nbsp;other pains and trials. We saw them calmly accept impossible situations, seeking neither to run or&nbsp;recriminate. This was not only faith; it was faith that worked well under all conditions. We soon&nbsp;concluded that whatever the price in humility we must pay we would pay.&quot;&nbsp;</span></span></div>

To most A.A.&#39;s he is not. There are too many of us that have been just like him,&nbsp;and have found the riddle&#39;s answer. This answer has to do with the quality of faith rather than the&nbsp;quantity. This has been our blind spot. We supposed we had humility, when we hadn&#39;t. We supposed&nbsp;we had been serious about religious practices, when upon honest appraisal, we found we had been&nbsp;only superficial. Or, going to the other extreme, we had wallowed in emotionalism and had mistaken&nbsp;it for true religious feeling. In both cases, we had been asking something for nothing. The fact was we&nbsp;really hadn&#39;t cleaned house so that the grace of God could enter us and expel the obsession. In no&nbsp;deep or meaningful sense had we ever taken stock of ourselves, made amends to those we had&nbsp;harmed, or freely given to any other human being without any demand for reward. We had not even&nbsp;prayed rightly. We had always said, &quot;Grant me my wishes&quot; instead of &quot;Thy will be done.&quot; The love of&nbsp;God and man we understood not at all. Therefore we remained self-deceived, and so incapable of&nbsp;receiving enough grace to restore us to sanity.</span></span></div>
