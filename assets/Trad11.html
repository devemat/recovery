									<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">WITHOUT its legions of well-wishers, A.A. could never have grown as it has. Throughout the world,&nbsp;immense and favorable publicity of every description has been the principal means of bringing&nbsp;alcoholics into our Fellowship. In A.A. offices, clubs, and homes, telephones ring constantly. One voice&nbsp;says, &quot;I read a piece in the newspapers. . .&quot;; another, &quot;We heard a radio program. . .&quot;; and still&nbsp;another, &quot;We saw a moving picture. . .&quot; or &quot;We saw something about A.A. on television. . . .&quot; It is no&nbsp;exaggeration to say that half of A.A.&#39;s membership has been led to us through channels like these.</span></span></div>

									<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">The inquiring voices are not all alcoholics or their families. Doctors read medical papers about&nbsp;Alcoholics Anonymous and call for more information. Clergymen see articles in their church journals&nbsp;and also make inquiries. Employers learn that great corporations have set their approval upon us, and&nbsp;wish to discover what can be done about alcoholism in their own firms.</span></span></div>

									<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Therefore, a great responsibility fell upon us to develop the best possible public relations policy for&nbsp;Alcoholics Anonymous. Through many painful experiences, we think we have arrived at what that&nbsp;policy ought to be. It is the </span></span></div>

								<div>
									<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">opposite in many ways of usual promotional practice. We found that we&nbsp;had to rely upon the principle of attraction rather than of promotion.</span></span></div>
								<div>
									&nbsp;</div>
								<div id="cke_pastebin">
									<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Let&#39;s see how these two contrasting ideas--attraction and promotion--work out. A political party&nbsp;wishes to win an election, so it advertises the virtues of its leadership to draw votes. A worthy charity&nbsp;wants to raise money; forthwith, its letterhead shows the name of every distinguished person whose&nbsp;support can be obtained. Much of the political, economic, and religious life of the world is dependent&nbsp;upon publicized leadership. People who symbolize causes and ideas fill a deep human need. We of A.A.&nbsp;do not question that. But we do have to soberly face the fact that being in the public eye is hazardous,&nbsp;especially for us. By temperament, nearly every one of us had been an irrepressible promoter, and&nbsp;the prospect of a society composed almost entirely of promoters was frightening. Considering this&nbsp;explosive factor, we knew we had to exercise self-restraint.</span></span></div>
								<div>
									&nbsp;</div>
								<div id="cke_pastebin">
									<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">The way this restraint paid off was startling. It resulted in more favorable publicity of Alcoholics&nbsp;Anonymous than could possibly have been obtained through all the arts and abilities of A.A.&#39;s best&nbsp;press agents. Obviously, A.A. had to be publicized somehow, so we resorted to the idea that it would&nbsp;be far better to let our friends do this for us. Precisely that has happened, to an unbelievable extent.&nbsp;Veteran newsmen, trained doubters that they are, have gone all out to carry A.A.&#39;s message. To them,&nbsp;we are something more than the source of good stories. On almost every newsfront, the men and&nbsp;women of the press have attached themselves to us as friends. </span></span></div>

									<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">In the beginning, the press could not&nbsp;understand our refusal of all personal publicity. They were genuinely baffled by our insistence upon&nbsp;anonymity. Then they got the point. Here was something rare in the world--a society which said it&nbsp;wished to publicize its principles and its work, but not its individual members. The press was&nbsp;delighted with this attitude. Ever since, these friends have reported A.A. with an enthusiasm which&nbsp;the most ardent members would find hard to match.</span></span></div>
								<div>
									&nbsp;</div>
								<div id="cke_pastebin">
									<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">There was actually a time when the press of America thought the anonymity of A.A. was better for us&nbsp;than some of our own members did. At one point, about a hundred of our Society were breaking&nbsp;anonymity at the public level. With perfectly good intent, these folks declared that the principle of&nbsp;anonymity was horse-and-buggy stuff, something appropriate to A.A.&#39;s pioneering days. They weresure that A.A. could go faster and farther if it availed itself of modern publicity methods. A.A., they&nbsp;pointed out, included many persons of local, national, or international fame. Provided they were&nbsp;willing--and many were--why shouldn&#39;t their membership be publicized, thereby encouraging others&nbsp;to join us? These were plausible arguments, but happily our friends of the writing profession&nbsp;disagreed with them.</span></span></div>

								<div id="cke_pastebin">
									<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">The Foundation* wrote letters to practically every news outlet in North America, setting forth our&nbsp;public relations policy of attraction rather than promotion, and emphasiz-</span></span></div>

									<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">ing personal anonymity as&nbsp;A.A.&#39;s greatest protection. Since that time, editors and rewrite men have repeatedly deleted names&nbsp;and pictures of members from A.A. copy; frequently, they have reminded ambitious individuals of&nbsp;A.A.&#39;s anonymity policy. They have even sacrificed good stories to this end. The force of their&nbsp;cooperation has certainly helped. Only a few A.A. members are left who deliberately break anonymity&nbsp;at the public level.</span></span></div>

									<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">This, in brief, is the process by which A.A.&#39;s Tradition Eleven was constructed. To us, however, it&nbsp;represents far more than a sound public relations policy. It is more than a denial of self-seeking. This&nbsp;Tradition is a constant and practical reminder that personal ambition has no place in A.A. In it, each&nbsp;member becomes an active guardian of our Fellowship.&nbsp;</span></span></div>
