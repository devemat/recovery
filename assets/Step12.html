Here we turn outward&nbsp;toward our fellow alcoholics who are still in distress. Here we experience the kind of giving that asks&nbsp;no rewards. Here we begin to practice all Twelve Steps of the program in our daily lives so that we&nbsp;and those about us may find emotional sobriety. When the Twelfth Step is seen in its full implication,&nbsp;it is really talking about the kind of love that has no price tag on it.</span></span></div>

												<div id="cke_pastebin">
													<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Our Twelfth Step also says that as a result of practicing all the Steps, we have each found something&nbsp;called a spiritual awakening. To new A.A.&#39;s, this often seems like a very dubious and improbable state&nbsp;of affairs. &quot;What do you mean when you talk about a &#39;spiritual awakening&#39;?&quot; they ask.</span></span></div>

												<div id="cke_pastebin">
													<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Maybe there are as many definitions of spiritual awakening as there are people who have had them.&nbsp;But certainly each genuine one has something in common with all the others. And these things which&nbsp;they have in common are not too hard to understand. When a man or a woman has a spiritual&nbsp;awakening, the most important meaning of it is that he has now become able to do, feel, and believe&nbsp;that</span></span></div>

He has been granted a&nbsp;gift which amounts to a new state of consciousness and being. He has been set on a path which tells&nbsp;him he is really going somewhere, that life is not a dead end, not something to be endured or&nbsp;mastered. In a very real sense he has been transformed, because he has laid hold of a source of&nbsp;strength which, in one way or another, he had hitherto denied himself. He finds himself in possession&nbsp;of a degree of honesty, tolerance, unselfishness, peace of mind, and love of which he had thought&nbsp;himself quite incapable. What he has received is a free gift, and yet usually, at least in some small&nbsp;part, he has made himself ready to receive it.</span></span></div>

												<div id="cke_pastebin">
													<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">A.A.&#39;s manner of making ready to receive this gift lies in the practice of the Twelve Steps in our&nbsp;program. So let&#39;s consider briefly what we have been trying to do up to this point:&nbsp;</span></span></div>
												<div>
													&nbsp;</div>
												<div>
													<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Step One showed us an amazing paradox: We found that we were totally unable to be rid of the&nbsp;alcohol obsession until we first admitted that we were powerless over it. In Step Two we saw that&nbsp;since we could not restore ourselves to sanity, some Higher Power must necessarily do so if we were&nbsp;to survive. Consequently, in Step Three we turned our will and our lives over to the care of God as we&nbsp;understood Him. For the time being, we who were atheist or agnostic discovered that our own group,&nbsp;or A.A. as a whole, would suffice as a higher power. Beginning with Step Four, we commenced to&nbsp;search out the things in ourselves which had brought us to physical, moral, and spiritual bankruptcy.&nbsp;We made a searching and fearless moral inventory. Looking at</span></span></div>

												</div>
												<div>
													<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Step Five, we decided that an&nbsp;inventory, taken alone, wouldn&#39;t be enough. We knew we would have to quit the deadly business of&nbsp;living alone with our conflicts, and in honesty confide these to God and another human being. At Step&nbsp;Six, many of us balked--for the practical reason that we did not wish to have all our defects of&nbsp;character removed, because we still loved some of them too much. Yet we knew we had to make a&nbsp;settlement with the fundamental principle of Step Six. So we decided that while we still had some&nbsp;flaws of character that we could not yet relinquish, we ought nevertheless to quit our stubborn,&nbsp;rebellious hanging on to them. We said to ourselves, &quot;This I cannot do today, perhaps, but I can stop&nbsp;crying out &#39;No, never!&#39;&quot; Then, in Step Seven, we humbly asked God to remove our shortcomings such&nbsp;as He could or would under the conditions of the day we asked. In Step Eight, we continued our&nbsp;housecleaning, for we saw that we were not only in conflict with ourselves, but also with people and&nbsp;situations in the world in which we lived. We had to begin to make our peace, and so we listed thepeople we had harmed and became willing to set things right. We followed this up in Step Nine by&nbsp;making direct amends to those concerned, except when it would injure them or other people. By this&nbsp;time, at Step Ten, we had begun to get a basis for daily living, and we keenly realized that we would&nbsp;need to continue taking personal inventory, and that when we were in the wrong we ought to admit it&nbsp;promptly. In Step Eleven we saw that if a Higher Power had restored us to sanity and had enabled us&nbsp;to live with some peace of mind in a sorely troubled world, then such a Higher Power was worth&nbsp;knowing better, by as</span></span></div>

												<div>
													<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">direct contact as possible. The persistent use of meditation and prayer, we&nbsp;found, did open the channel so that where there had been a trickle, there now was a river which led to&nbsp;sure power and safe guidance from God as we were increasingly better able to understand Him.</span></span></div>
												<div>
													&nbsp;</div>
												<div>
													<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">So, practicing these Steps, we had a spiritual awakening about which finally there was no question.&nbsp;Looking at those who were only beginning and still doubted themselves, the rest of us were able to see&nbsp;the change setting in. From great numbers of such experiences, we could predict that the doubter&nbsp;who still claimed that he hadn&#39;t got the &quot;spiritual angle,&quot; and who still considered his well-loved A.A.&nbsp;group the higher power, would presently love God and call Him by name.</span></span></div>
												<div>
													&nbsp;</div>
												<div id="cke_pastebin">
													<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Now, what about the rest of the Twelfth Step? The wonderful energy it releases and the eager action&nbsp;by which it carries our message to the next suffering alcoholic and which finally translates the Twelve&nbsp;Steps into action upon all our affairs is the payoff, the magnificent reality, of Alcoholics Anonymous.</span></span></div>

													<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Even the newest of newcomers finds undreamed rewards as he tries to help his brother alcoholic, the&nbsp;one who is even blinder than he. This is indeed the kind of giving that actually demands nothing. He&nbsp;does not expect his brother sufferer to pay him, or even to love him. And then he discovers that by&nbsp;the divine paradox of this kind of giving he has found his own reward, whether his brother has yet&nbsp;received anything or not. His own character may still be gravely defective, but he somehow knows&nbsp;that God has enabled him to make a mighty beginning, and he senses that he stands</span></span></div>

												<div>
													&nbsp;</div>
												<div id="cke_pastebin">
													<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Practically every A.A. member declares that no satisfaction has been deeper and no joy greater than&nbsp;in a Twelfth Step job well done. To watch the eyes of men and women open with wonder as they move&nbsp;from darkness into light, to see their lives quickly fill with new purpose and meaning, to see whole&nbsp;families reassembled, to see the alcoholic outcast received back into his community in full citizenship,&nbsp;and above all to watch these people awaken to the presence of a loving God in their lives--these things&nbsp;are the substance of what we receive as we carry A.A.&#39;s message to the next alcoholic.&nbsp;</span></span></div>
												<div>
													&nbsp;</div>
												<div>
													<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Nor is this the only kind of Twelfth Step work. We sit in A.A. meetings and listen, not only to receive&nbsp;something ourselves, but to give the reassurance and support which our presence can bring. If our&nbsp;turn comes to speak at a meeting, we again try to carry A.A.&#39;s message. Whether our audience is one&nbsp;or many, it is still Twelfth Step work. There are many opportunities even for those of us who feel&nbsp;unable to speak at meetings or who are so situated that we cannot do much face-to-face Twelfth Step&nbsp;work. We can be the ones who take on the unspectacular but important tasks that make good Twelfth&nbsp;Step work possible, perhaps arranging for the coffee and cake after the meetings, where so many&nbsp;skeptical, suspicious newcomers have found confidence and comfort in the laughter and talk. This is&nbsp;Twelfth Step work in the very best sense of the word. &quot;Freely ye have received; freely give. . .&quot; is the&nbsp;core of this part of Step Twelve.</span></span></div>

These will appear as big setbacks at the time, but will be seen later as stepping-stones to better&nbsp;things. For example, we may set our hearts on getting a particular person sobered up, and after doing&nbsp;all we can for months, we see him relapse. Perhaps this will happen in a succession of cases, and we&nbsp;may be deeply discouraged as to our ability to carry A.A.&#39;s message. Or we may encounter the&nbsp;reverse situation, in which we are highly elated because we seem to have been successful. Here the&nbsp;temptation is to become rather possessive of these newcomers. Perhaps we try to give them advice&nbsp;about their affairs which we aren&#39;t really competent to give or ought not give at all. Then we are hurt&nbsp;and confused when the advice is rejected, or when it is accepted and brings still greater confusion. By&nbsp;a great deal of ardent Twelfth Step work we sometimes carry the message to so many alcoholics that&nbsp;they place us in a position of trust. They make us, let us say, the group&#39;s chairman. Here again we arepresented with the temptation to overmanage things, and sometimes this results in rebuffs and other&nbsp;consequences which are hard to take.</span></span></div>
												<div>
													&nbsp;</div>
												<div id="cke_pastebin">
													<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">But in the longer run we clearly realize that these are only the pains of growing up, and nothing but&nbsp;good can come from them if we turn more and more to the entire Twelve Steps for the answers.&nbsp;</span></span></div>
												<div>
													&nbsp;</div>
												<div>
													<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Now comes the biggest question yet. What about the practice of these principles in all our affairs? Can&nbsp;we love the whole pattern of living as eagerly as we do the small segment of it we discover when we&nbsp;try to help other alcoholics achieve sobriety? Can we bring the same spirit of&nbsp;</span></span></div>

Can we have the same kind of&nbsp;confidence and faith in these people who have been infected and sometimes crippled by our own&nbsp;illness that we have in our sponsors? Can we actually carry the A.A. spirit into our daily work? Can we&nbsp;meet our newly recognized responsibilities to the world at large? And can we bring new purpose and&nbsp;devotion to the religion of our choice? Can we find a new joy of living in trying to do something about&nbsp;all these things?</span></span></div>
												<div>
													&nbsp;</div>
												<div id="cke_pastebin">
													<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Furthermore, how shall we come to terms with seeming failure or success? Can we now accept and&nbsp;adjust to either without despair or pride? Can we accept poverty, sickness, loneliness, and&nbsp;bereavement with courage and serenity? Can we steadfastly content ourselves with the humbler, yet&nbsp;sometimes more durable, satisfactions when the brighter, more glittering achievements are denied&nbsp;us?</span></span></div>
												<div>
													&nbsp;</div>
												<div>
													<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">The A.A. answer to these questions about living is &quot;Yes, all of these things are possible.&quot; We know&nbsp;this because we see monotony, pain, and even calamity turned to good use by those who keep on&nbsp;trying to practice A.A.&#39;s Twelve Steps. And if these are facts of life for the many alcoholics who have&nbsp;recovered in A.A., they can become the facts of life for many more.</span></span></div>
												<div>
													&nbsp;</div>
												<div>
													<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Of course all A.A.&#39;s, even the best,&nbsp;fall far short of such achievements as a consistent thing. Without necessarily taking that first drink,&nbsp;we often get quite far off the beam. Our troubles sometimes begin with indifference. We are sober and&nbsp;happy in our A.A. work. Things go well at home and office. We naturally congratulate ourselves on&nbsp;what later&nbsp;</span></span></div>

We temporarily cease to grow&nbsp;because we feel satisfied that there is no need for all of A.A.&#39;s Twelve Steps for us. We are doing fine&nbsp;on a few of them. Maybe we are doing fine on only two of them, the First Step and that part of the&nbsp;Twelfth where we &quot;carry the message.&quot; In A.A. slang, that blissful state is known as &quot;two-stepping.&quot;&nbsp;And it can go on for years.</span></span></div>
												<div>
													&nbsp;</div>
												<div id="cke_pastebin">
													<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">The best-intentioned of us can fall for the &quot;two-step&quot; illusion. Sooner or later the pink cloud stage&nbsp;wears off and things go disappointingly dull. We begin to think that A.A. doesn&#39;t pay off after all. We&nbsp;become puzzled and discouraged.</span></span></div>
												<div>
													&nbsp;</div>
												<div id="cke_pastebin">
													<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Then perhaps life, as it has a way of doing, suddenly hands us a great big lump that we can&#39;t begin to&nbsp;swallow, let alone digest. We fail to get a worked-for promotion. We lose that good job. Maybe there&nbsp;are serious domestic or romantic difficulties, or perhaps that boy we thought God was looking after&nbsp;becomes a military casualty.</span></span></div>

													&nbsp;</div>
												<div id="cke_pastebin">
													<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">What then? Have we alcoholics in A.A. got, or can we get, the resources to meet these calamities&nbsp;which come to so many? These were problems of life which we could never face up to. Can we now,&nbsp;with the help of God as we understand Him, handle them as well and as bravely as our non-alcoholic&nbsp;friends often do? Can we transform these calamities into assets, sources of growth and comfort to&nbsp;ourselves and those about us? Well, we surely have a chance if we switch from &quot;two-stepping&quot; to&nbsp;&quot;twelve-stepping,&quot; if we are willing to receive that grace of God which can sustain and strengthen us&nbsp;in any catastrophe.</span></span></div>

We have seen&nbsp;A.A.&#39;s suffer lingering and fatal illness with little complaint, and often in good cheer. We have&nbsp;sometimes seen families broken apart by misunderstanding, tensions, or actual infidelity, who are&nbsp;reunited by the A.A. way of life.</span></span></div>

But also like others, we&nbsp;often discover a greater challenge in the lesser and more continuous problems of life. Our answer is in&nbsp;still more spiritual development. Only by this means can we improve our chances for really happy and&nbsp;useful living. And as we grow spiritually, we find that our old attitudes toward our instincts need to&nbsp;undergo drastic revisions. Our desires for emotional security and wealth, for personal prestige and&nbsp;power, for romance, and for family satisfactions--all these have to be tempered and redirected. We&nbsp;have learned that the satisfaction of instincts cannot be the sole end and aim of our lives. If we place&nbsp;instincts first, we have got the cart before the horse; we shall be pulled backward into disillusionment.&nbsp;But when we are willing to place spiritual growth first--then and only then do we have a real chance.</span></span></div>

Our demand for emotional security,&nbsp;for our own way, had constantly thrown us into unworkable relations with other people. Though we&nbsp;were sometimes quite unconscious of this, the result always had been the same. Either we had tried to&nbsp;play God and dominate those about us, or we had insisted on being overdependent upon them. Where&nbsp;people had temporarily let us run their lives as though they were still children, we had felt very happy&nbsp;and secure ourselves. But when they finally resisted or ran away, we were bitterly hurt and&nbsp;disappointed. We blamed them, being quite unable to see that our unreasonable demands had been&nbsp;the cause.</span></span></div>

													<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">When we had taken the opposite tack and had insisted, like infants ourselves, that people protect and&nbsp;take care of us or that the world owed us a living, then the result had been equally unfortunate. This&nbsp;often caused the people we had loved most to push us aside or perhaps desert us entirely. Our&nbsp;disillusionment had been hard to bear. We couldn&#39;t imagine people acting that way toward us. We had&nbsp;failed to see that though adult in years we were still behaving childishly, trying to turn everybody--&nbsp;friends, wives, husbands, even the world itself--into protective parents. We had refused to learn the&nbsp;very hard lesson that overdependence upon people is unsuccessful because all people are fallible, and&nbsp;even the best of them will sometimes let us down, especially when our demands for attention become&nbsp;unreasonable.</span></span></div>

It became clear that if we ever were to&nbsp;feel emotionally secure among grown-up people, we would have to put our lives on a give-and-take&nbsp;basis; we would have to develop the sense of being in partnership or brotherhood with all those&nbsp;around us. We saw that we would need to give constantly of ourselves without demands for&nbsp;repayment. When we persistently did this we gradually found that people were attracted to us as&nbsp;never before. And even if they failed us, we could be understanding and not too seriously affected.</span></span></div>

													<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">When we developed still more, we discovered the best possible source of emotional stability to be God&nbsp;Himself. We found that dependence upon His perfect justice, forgiveness, and love was healthy, and&nbsp;that it would work where nothing else would. If we really depended upon God, we couldn&#39;t very well&nbsp;play God to our fellows nor would we feel the urge wholly to rely on human protection and care. These&nbsp;were the new attitudes that finally brought many of us an inner strength and peace that could not be&nbsp;deeply shaken by the shortcomings of others or by any calamity not of our own making.</span></span></div>

But when selfwill had driven everybody away and our isolation had become complete, it caused us to play the big&nbsp;shot in cheap barrooms and then fare forth alone on the street to depend upon the charity of&nbsp;passersby.

But just like all other societies, we do have&nbsp;sex and marital problems, and sometimes they are distressingly acute. Permanent marriage breakups&nbsp;and separations, however, are unusual in A.A. Our main problem is not how we are to stay married; it&nbsp;is how to be more happily married by eliminating the severe emotional twists that have so often&nbsp;stemmed from alcoholism.</span></span></div>

This mighty urge is the root of great human accomplishments, a creative energy that&nbsp;deeply influences our lives. God fashioned us that way. So our question will be this: How, by&nbsp;ignorance, compulsion, and self-will, do we misuse this gift for our own destruction?

If the man is affected, the wife must become the head of the house,&nbsp;often the breadwinner. As matters get worse, the husband becomes a sick and irresponsible child who&nbsp;needs to be looked after and extricated from endless scrapes and impasses. Very gradually, and&nbsp;usually without any realization of the fact, the wife is forced to become the mother of an erring boy.&nbsp;And if she had a strong maternal instinct to begin with, the situation is aggravated. Obviously not&nbsp;much partnership can exist under these conditions. The wife usually goes on doing the best she knows&nbsp;how, but meanwhile the alcoholic alternately loves and hates her maternal care. A pattern is thereby&nbsp;established that may take a lot of undoing later on. Nevertheless, under the influence of A.A.&#39;s Twelve&nbsp;Steps, these situations are often set right.</span></span></div>

The alcoholic, realizing what his wife has endured, and now fully&nbsp;understanding how much he himself did to damage her and his children, nearly always takes up his&nbsp;marriage responsibilities with a willingness to repair what he can and to accept what he can&#39;t. He&nbsp;persistently tries all of A.A.&#39;s Twelve Steps in his home, often with fine results. At this point he firmly&nbsp;but lovingly commences to behave like a partner instead of like a bad boy.

It&nbsp;is only where &quot;boy meets girl on A.A. campus,&quot; and love follows at first sight, that difficulties may&nbsp;develop. The prospective partners need to be solid A.A.&#39;s and long enough acquainted to know that&nbsp;their compatibility at spiritual, mental, and emotional levels is a fact and not wishful thinking. They&nbsp;need to be as sure as possible that no deep-lying emotional handicap in either will be likely to rise up&nbsp;under later pressures to cripple them.

If they cannot have this kind of happiness, can A.A. offer them satisfactions of similar worth&nbsp;and durability? Yes--whenever they try hard to seek them out. Surrounded by so many A.A. friends,these so-called loners tell us they no longer feel alone. In partnership with others -women and men--&nbsp;they can devote themselves to any number of ideas, people, and constructive projects. Free of marital&nbsp;responsibilities, they can participate in enterprises which would be denied to family men and women.&nbsp;We daily see such members render prodigies of service, and receive great joys in return.</span></span></div>

With a few exceptions, all of us had been spendthrifts. We threw money about&nbsp;in every direction with the purpose of pleasing ourselves and impressing other people. In our drinking&nbsp;time, we acted as if the money supply was inexhaustible, though between binges we&#39;d sometimes go&nbsp;to the other extreme and become almost miserly. Without realizing it we were just accumulating&nbsp;funds for the next spree. Money was the symbol of pleasure and self-importance. When our drinking&nbsp;had become much worse, money was only an urgent requirement which could supply us with the next&nbsp;drink and the temporary comfort of oblivion it brought.</span></span></div>

The spectacle of years of waste threw us into panic. There simply wouldn&#39;t be time, we&nbsp;thought, to rebuild our shattered fortunes. How could we ever take care of those awful debts, possess&nbsp;a decent home, educate the kids, and set something by for old age? Financial importance was no&nbsp;longer our principal aim; we now clamored for material security. Even when we were well&nbsp;reestablished in our business, these terrible fears often continued to haunt us. This made us misers&nbsp;and penny pinchers all over again. Complete financial security we must have--or else. We forgot that&nbsp;most alcoholics in A.A. have an earning power considerably above average; we forgot the immense&nbsp;goodwill of our brother A.A.&#39;s who were only too eager to help us to better jobs when we deserved&nbsp;them; we forgot the actual or potential financial insecurity of every human being in the world. And,&nbsp;worst of all, we forgot God. In money matters we had faith only in ourselves, and not too much of that.</span></span></div>

It did not&nbsp;matter too much what our material condition was, but it did matter what our spiritual condition was.&nbsp;Money gradually became our servant and not our master. It became a means of exchanging love and&nbsp;service with those about us. When, with God&#39;s help, we calmly accepted our lot, then we found we&nbsp;could live at peace with ourselves and show others who still suffered the same fears that they could&nbsp;get over them, too.

He learns that he can be content as long as he plays well&nbsp;whatever cards life deals him. He&#39;s still ambitious, but not absurdly so, because he can now see and&nbsp;accept actual reality.

The doctors weren&#39;t&nbsp;trying to find how different we were from one another; they sought to find whatever personality&nbsp;traits, if any, this group of alcoholics had in common. They finally came up with a conclusion that&nbsp;shocked the A.A. members of that time. These distinguished men had the nerve to say that most ofthe alcoholics under investigation were still childish, emotionally sensitive, and grandiose.</span></span></div>

													<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">How we alcoholics did resent that verdict! We would not believe that our adult dreams were often&nbsp;truly childish. And considering the rough deal life had given us, we felt it perfectly natural that we&nbsp;were sensitive. As to our grandiose behavior, we insisted that we had been possessed of nothing but a&nbsp;high and legitimate ambition to win the battle of life.</span></span></div>

We have had a much&nbsp;keener look at ourselves and those about us. We have seen that we were prodded by unreasonable&nbsp;fears or anxieties into making a life business of winning fame, money, and what we thought was&nbsp;leadership. So false pride became the reverse side of that ruinous coin marked &quot;Fear.&quot; We simply had&nbsp;to be number one people to cover up our deep-lying inferiorities. In fitful successes we boasted of&nbsp;greater feats to be done; in defeat we were bitter. If we didn&#39;t have much of any worldly success we&nbsp;became depressed and cowed. Then people said we were of the &quot;inferior&quot; type. But now we see&nbsp;ourselves as chips off the same old block. At heart we had all been abnormally fearful. It mattered&nbsp;little whether we had sat on the shore of life drinking ourselves into forgetfulness or had plunged in&nbsp;recklessly and willfully beyond our depth and </span></span></div>

We no longer strive to dominate or rule those about us in order to gain&nbsp;self-importance. We no longer seek fame and honor in order to be praised. When by devoted service&nbsp;to family, friends, business, or community we attract widespread affection and are sometimes singled&nbsp;out for posts of greater responsibility and trust, we try to be humbly grateful and exert ourselves the&nbsp;more in a spirit of love and service.
