					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">CREATION gave us instincts for a purpose. Without them we wouldn&#39;t be complete human beings. If&nbsp;men and women didn&#39;t exert themselves to be secure in their persons, made no effort to harvest food&nbsp;or construct shelter, there would be no survival. If they didn&#39;t reproduce, the earth wouldn&#39;t be&nbsp;populated. If there were no social instinct, if men cared nothing for the society of one another, there&nbsp;would be no society. So these desires-for the sex relation, for material and emotional security, and for&nbsp;companionship-are perfectly necessary and right, and surely God-given.</span></span></div>
				<div>
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Yet these instincts, so necessary for our existence, often far exceed their proper functions.&nbsp;Powerfully, blindly, many times subtly, they drive us, dominate us, and insist upon ruling our lives.&nbsp;Our desires for sex, for material and emotional security, and for an important place in society often&nbsp;tyrannize us. When thus out of joint, man&#39;s natural desires cause him great trouble, practically all the&nbsp;trouble there is. No human being, however good, is exempt from these troubles. Nearly every serious&nbsp;emotional problem can be seen as a case of misdirected instinct. When that happens, our great&nbsp;natural assets, the instincts, have turned into physical and mental liabilities.</span></span></div>
				<div>
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Step Four is our vigorous and painstaking effort to discover what these liabilities in each of us have&nbsp;been, and are.</span></span></div>

						43</h2>
				</div>
				<div>
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">We want to find exactly how, when and where our natural desires have warped us. We&nbsp;wish to look squarely at the unhappiness this has caused others and ourselves. By discovering what&nbsp;our emotional deformities are, we can move toward their correction. Without a willing and persistent&nbsp;effort to do this, there can be little sobriety or contentment for us. Without a searching and fearless&nbsp;moral inventory, most of us have found that the faith which really works in daily living is still out of&nbsp;reach.</span></span></div>
				<div>
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Before tackling the inventory problem in detail, let&#39;s have a closer look at what the basic problem is.&nbsp;Simple examples like the following take on a world of meaning when we think about them. Suppose a&nbsp;person places sex desire ahead of everything else. In such a case, this imperious urge can destroy his&nbsp;chances for material and emotional security as well as his standing in the community. Another may&nbsp;develop such an obsession for financial security that he wants to do nothing but hoard money. Going&nbsp;to the extreme, he can become a miser, or even a recluse who denies himself both family and friends.&nbsp;</span></span></div>
				<div>
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div>
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Nor is the quest for security always expressed in terms of money. How frequently we see a&nbsp;frightened human being determined to depend completely upon a stronger person for guidance and&nbsp;protection. This weak one, failing to meet life&#39;s responsibilities with his own resources, never grows&nbsp;up. Disillusionment and helplessness are his lot. In time all his protectors either flee or die, and he is&nbsp;once more left alone and afraid.</span></span></div>
				<div>
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">We have also seen men and women who go power-mad, who devote themselves to attempting to rule&nbsp;their fellows.</span></span></div>

						44</h2>
				</div>
				<div>
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">These people often throw to the winds every chance for legitimate security and a happy&nbsp;family life. Whenever a human being becomes a battleground for the instincts, there can be no peace.&nbsp;</span></span></div>
				<div>
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div>
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">But that is not all of the danger. Every time a person imposes his instincts unreasonably upon others,&nbsp;unhappiness follows. If the pursuit of wealth tramples upon people who happen to be in the way, then&nbsp;anger, jealousy, and revenge are likely to be aroused. If sex runs riot, there is a similar uproar.&nbsp;Demands made upon other people for too much attention, protection, and love can only invite&nbsp;domination or revulsion in the protectors themselves-two emotions quite as unhealthy as the&nbsp;demands which evoked them. When an individual&#39;s desire for prestige becomes uncontrollable,whether in the sewing circle or at the international conference table, other people suffer and often&nbsp;revolt. This collision of instincts can produce anything from a cold snub to a blazing revolution. In&nbsp;these ways we are set in conflict not only with ourselves, but with other people who have instincts,&nbsp;too.</span></span></div>

					&nbsp;</div>
				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Alcoholics especially should be able to see that instinct run wild in themselves is the underlying cause&nbsp;of their destructive drinking. We have drunk to drown feelings of fear, frustration, and depression.&nbsp;We have drunk to escape the guilt of passions, and then have drunk again to make more passions&nbsp;possible. We have drunk for vainglory-that we might the more enjoy foolish dreams of pomp and&nbsp;power. This perverse soul-sickness is not pleasant to look upon. Instincts on rampage balk at&nbsp;investigation. The minute we</span></span></div>

				<div>
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">If temperamentally we are on the depressive side, we are apt to be swamped with guilt and selfloathing. We wallow in this messy bog, often getting a misshapen and painful pleasure out of it. As we&nbsp;morbidly pursue this melancholy activity, we may sink to such a point of despair that nothing but&nbsp;oblivion looks possible as a solution. Here, of course, we have lost all perspective, and therefore all&nbsp;genuine humility. For this is pride in reverse. This is not a moral inventory at all; it is the very&nbsp;process by which the depressive has so often been led to the bottle and extinction.&nbsp;</span></span></div>
				<div>
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div>
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">If, however, our natural disposition is inclined to self-righteousness or grandiosity, our reaction will&nbsp;be just the opposite. We will be offended at A.A.&#39;s suggested inventory. No doubt we shall point with&nbsp;pride to the good lives we thought we led before the bottle cut us down. We shall claim that our&nbsp;serious character defects, if we think we have any at all, have been caused chiefly by excessive&nbsp;drinking. This being so, we think it logically follows that sobriety-first, last, and all the time-is the&nbsp;only thing we need to work for. We believe that our one-time good characters will be revived the&nbsp;moment we quit alcohol. If we were pretty nice people all along, except for our drinking, what need is&nbsp;there for a moral inventory now that we are sober?</span></span></div>
				<div>
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">We also clutch at another wonderful excuse for avoiding an inventory. Our present anxieties and&nbsp;trouble, we cry, are caused by the behavior of other people-people who <em>really </em>need a moral&nbsp;inventory. We firmly believe that if only</span></span></div>

				<div>
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">At this stage of the inventory proceedings, our sponsors come to the rescue. They can do this, for&nbsp;they are the carriers of A.A.&#39;s tested experience with Step Four. They comfort the melancholy one by&nbsp;first showing him that his case is not strange or different, that his character defects are probably not&nbsp;more numerous or worse than those of anyone else in A.A. This the sponsor promptly proves by&nbsp;talking freely and easily, and without exhibitionism, about his own defects, past and present. This&nbsp;calm, yet realistic, stocktaking is immensely reassuring. The sponsor probably points out that the&nbsp;newcomer has some assets which can be noted along with his liabilities. This tends to clear away&nbsp;morbidity and encourage balance. As soon as he begins to be more objective, the newcomer can&nbsp;fearlessly, rather than fearfully, look at his own defects.</span></span></div>
				<div>
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">The sponsors of those who feel they need no inventory are confronted with quite another problem.&nbsp;This is because people who are driven by pride of self unconsciously blind themselves to their&nbsp;liabilities. These newcomers scarcely need comforting. The problem is to help them discover a chink&nbsp;in the walls their ego has built, through which the light of reason can shine.&nbsp;</span></span></div>
				<div>
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div>
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">First off, they can be told that the majority of A.A. members have suffered severely from selfjustification during their drinking days. For most of us, self-justification was the maker of excuses;&nbsp;excuses, of course, for drinking, and for</span></span></div>

						47</h2>
				</div>
				<div>
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">all kinds of crazy and damaging conduct. We had made the&nbsp;invention of alibis a fine art. We had to drink because times were hard or times were good. We had to&nbsp;drink because at home we were smothered with love or got none at all. We had to drink because at&nbsp;work we were great successes or dismal failures. We had to drink because our nation had won a war&nbsp;or lost a peace. And so it went, ad infinitum.</span></span></div>
				<div>
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div>
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">We thought &quot;conditions&quot; drove us to drink, and when we tried to correct these conditions and found&nbsp;that we couldn&#39;t to our entire satisfaction, our drinking went out of hand and we became alcoholics. It&nbsp;never occurred to us that we needed to change ourselves to meet conditions, whatever they were.</span></span></div>
				<div>
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">But in A.A. we slowly learned that something had to be done about our vengeful resentments, selfpity, and unwarranted pride. We had to see that every time we played the big shot, we turned people&nbsp;against us. We had to see that when we harbored grudges and planned revenge for such defeats, we&nbsp;were really beating ourselves with the club of anger we had intended to use on others. We learned&nbsp;that if we were seriously disturbed, our first need was to quiet that disturbance, regardless of who or&nbsp;what we thought caused it.</span></span></div>
				<div>
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">To see how erratic emotions victimized us often took a long time. We could perceive them quickly in&nbsp;others, but only slowly in ourselves. First of all, we had to admit that we had many of these defects,&nbsp;even though such disclosures were painful and humiliating. Where other people were concerned, we&nbsp;had to drop the word &quot;blame&quot; from our speech and thought. This required great willingness even to&nbsp;begin. But once over the first two or three high hurdles, the course</span></span></div>

				<div>
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">ahead began to look easier. For we&nbsp;had started to get perspective on ourselves, which is another way of saying that we were gaining in&nbsp;humility.</span></span></div>
				<div>
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Of course the depressive and the power-driver are personality extremes, types with which A.A. and&nbsp;the whole world abound. Often these personalities are just as sharply defined as the examples given.&nbsp;But just as often some of us will fit more or less into both classification. Human beings are never quite&nbsp;alike, so each of us, when making an inventory, will need to determine what his individual character&nbsp;defects are. Having found the shoes that fit, he ought to step into them and walk with new confidence&nbsp;that he is at last on the right track.</span></span></div>
				<div>
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Now let&#39;s ponder the need for a list of the more glaring personality defects all of us have in varying&nbsp;degrees. To those having religious training, such a list would set forth serious violations of moral&nbsp;principles. Some others will think of this list as defects of character. Still others will call it an index of&nbsp;maladjustments. Some will become quite annoyed if there is talk about immorality, let alone sin. But&nbsp;all who are in the least reasonable will agree upon one point: that there is plenty wrong with us&nbsp;alcoholics about which plenty will have to be done if we are to expect sobriety, progress, and any real&nbsp;ability to cope with life.</span></span></div>
				<div>
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">To avoid falling into confusion over the names these defects should be called, let&#39;s take a universally&nbsp;recognized list of major human failings-the Seven Deadly Sins of pride, greed, lust, anger, gluttony,&nbsp;envy, and sloth. It is not by accident that pride heads the procession. For pride, leading to selfjustification, and always spurred by conscious or un-</span></span></div>

				</div>
				<div>
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">conscious fears, is the basic breeder of most&nbsp;human difficulties, the chief block to true progress. Pride lures us into making demands upon&nbsp;ourselves or upon others which cannot be met without perverting or misusing our God-given&nbsp;instincts. When the satisfaction of our instincts for sex, security, and society becomes the sole object&nbsp;of our lives, then pride steps in to justify our excesses.</span></span></div>
				<div>
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">All these failings generate fear, a soul-sickness in its own right. Then fear, in turn, generates more&nbsp;character defects. Unreasonable fear that our instincts will not be satisfied drives us to covet the&nbsp;possessions of others, to lust for sex and power, to become angry when our instinctive demands are&nbsp;threatened, to be envious when the ambitions of others seem to be realized while ours are not. We&nbsp;eat, drink, and grab for more of everything than we need, fearing we shall never have enough. And&nbsp;with genuine alarm at the prospect of work, we stay lazy. We loaf and procrastinate, or at best work&nbsp;grudgingly and under half steam. These fears are the termites that ceaselessly devour the&nbsp;foundations of whatever sort of life we try to build.</span></span></div>
				<div>
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">So when A.A. suggests a fearless moral inventory, it must seem to every newcomer that more is&nbsp;being asked of him than he can do. Both his pride and his fear beat him back every time he tries to&nbsp;look within himself. Prides says, &quot;You need not pass this way,&quot; and Fear says, &quot;You dare not look!&quot;&nbsp;But the testimony of A.A.&#39;s who have really tried a moral inventory is that pride and fear of this sortturn out to be bogeymen, nothing else. Once we have a complete willingness to take inventory, and&nbsp;exert ourselves to do the job thoroughly, a wonderful light falls upon this</span></span></div>

As we persist, a&nbsp;brand-new kind of confidence is born, and the sense of relief at finally facing ourselves is&nbsp;indescribable. These are the first fruits of Step Four.</span></span></div>
				<div>
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">By now the newcomer has probably arrived at the following conclusions: that his character defects,&nbsp;representing instincts gone astray, have been the primary cause of his drinking and his failure at life;&nbsp;that unless he is now willing to work hard at the elimination of the worst of these defects, both&nbsp;sobriety and peace of mind will still elude him; that all the faulty foundation of his life will have to be&nbsp;torn out and built anew on bedrock. Now willing to commence the search for his own defects, he will&nbsp;ask, &quot;Just how do I go about this? How do I take inventory of myself?&quot;</span></span></div>
				<div>
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Since Step Four is but the beginning of a lifetime practice, it can be suggested that he first have a look&nbsp;at those personal flaws which are acutely troublesome and fairly obvious. Using his best judgment of&nbsp;what has been right and what has been wrong, he might make a rough survey of his conduct with&nbsp;respect to his primary instincts for sex, security, and society. Looking back over his life, he can&nbsp;readily get under way by consideration of questions such as these:&nbsp;</span></span></div>
				<div>
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div>
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">When, and how, and in just what instances did my selfish pursuit of the sex relation damage other&nbsp;people and me? What people were hurt, and how badly? Did I spoil my marriage and injure my&nbsp;children? Did I jeopardize my standing in the community? Just how did I react to these situations at&nbsp;the time? Did I burn with a guilt that nothing could extinguish? Or did I insist that I was the pursued&nbsp;and not the pursuer, and thus absolve myself? How have I reacted to</span></span></div>

Did I take it out on other people? If there was&nbsp;rejection or coldness at home, did I use this as a reason for promiscuity?</span></span></div>
				<div>
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Also of importance for most alcoholics are the questions they must ask about their behavior&nbsp;respecting financial and emotional security. In these areas fear, greed, possessiveness, and pride have&nbsp;too often done their worst. Surveying his business or employment record, almost any alcoholic can&nbsp;ask questions like these: In addition to my drinking problem, what character defects contributed to&nbsp;my financial instability? Did fear and inferiority about my fitness for my job destroy my confidence&nbsp;and fill me with conflict? Did I try to cover up those feeling so inadequacy by bluffing, cheating, lying,&nbsp;or evading responsibility? Or by griping that others failed to recognize my truly exceptional abilities?&nbsp;Did I overvalue myself and play the big shot? Did I have such unprincipled ambition that I doublecrossed and undercut my associates? Was I extravagant? Did I recklessly borrow money, caring little&nbsp;whether it was repaid or not? Was I a pinchpenny, refusing to support my family properly? Did I cut&nbsp;corners financially? What about the &quot;quick money&quot; deals, the stock market, and the races?</span></span></div>

					&nbsp;</div>
				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Businesswomen in A.A. will naturally find that many of these questions apply to them, too. But the&nbsp;alcoholic housewife can also make the family financially insecure. She can juggle charge accounts,&nbsp;manipulate the food budget, spend her afternoons gambling, and run her husband into debt by&nbsp;irresponsibility, waste, and extravagance.</span></span></div>

				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">The most common symptoms of emotional insecurity are worry, anger, self-pity, and depression.&nbsp;These stem from causes which sometimes seem to be within us, and at other times to come from&nbsp;without. To take inventory in this respect we ought to consider carefully all personal relationships&nbsp;which bring continuous or recurring trouble. It should be remembered that this kind of insecurity&nbsp;may arise in any area where instincts are threatened. Questioning directed to this end might run like&nbsp;this: Looking at both past and present, what sex situations have cause me anxiety, bitterness,&nbsp;frustration, or depression? Appraising each situation fairly, can I see where I have been at fault? Did&nbsp;these perplexities beset me because of selfishness or unreasonable demands? Or, if my disturbance&nbsp;was seemingly caused by the behavior of others, why do I lack the ability to accept conditions I&nbsp;cannot change? These are the sort of fundamental inquiries that can disclose the source of mydiscomfort and indicate whether I may be able to alter my own conduct and so adjust myself serenely&nbsp;to self-discipline.</span></span></div>

We have been especially stupid and stubborn about them. The primary fact that&nbsp;we fail to recognize is our total inability to form a true partnership with another human being. Our&nbsp;egomania digs two disastrous pitfalls. Either we insist upon dominating the people we know, or we&nbsp;depend upon them far too much. If we lean too heavily on people, they will sooner or later fail us, for&nbsp;they are human, too, and cannot possibly meet our incessant demands. In this way our insecurity&nbsp;grows and festers. When we habitually try to manipulate others to our own willful desires, they&nbsp;revolt, and resist us heavily. Then we develop hurt feelings, a sense of persecution, and a desire to&nbsp;retaliate. As we redouble our efforts at control, and continue to fail, our suffering becomes acute and&nbsp;constant. We have not once sought to be one in a family, to be a friend among friends, to be a worker&nbsp;among workers, to be a useful member of society. Always we tried to struggle to the top of the heap,&nbsp;or to hide underneath it. This self-centered behavior blocked a partnership relation with any one of&nbsp;those about us. Of true brotherhood we had small comprehension.</span></span></div>
