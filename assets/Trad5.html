			<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Alcoholics Anonymous can be likened to a group of physicians who might find a cure for cancer, and&nbsp;upon whose concerted work would depend the answer for sufferers of this disease. True, each&nbsp;physician in such a group might have his own speciality. Every doctor concerned would at times wish&nbsp;he could devote himself to his chosen field rather than work only with the group. But once these men&nbsp;had hit upon a cure, once it became apparent that only by their united effort couild this be&nbsp;accomplised, then all of them would feel bound to devote themselves solely to the relief of cancer. In&nbsp;the radience of such a miraculous discovery, any doctor would set his other ambitions aside, at&nbsp;whatever the personal cost.</span></span></div>

The only thing that matters is that he is an&nbsp;alcoholic who has found a key to sobriety. These legacies of suffering and of recovery are easily passed&nbsp;amoung alcoholics, one to the other. This is our gift from God, and its bestowal upon others like us is&nbsp;the one aim that today animates A.A.&#39;s all around the globe.</span></span></div>

		<div id="cke_pastebin">
			<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">There is another reason for this singleness of purpose. It is the great paradox of A.A. that we know we&nbsp;can seldom keep the precious gift of sobriety unless we give it away. If a group of doctors possessed a&nbsp;cancer cure, they might be conscious stricken if they failed their mission through self-seeking. Yet&nbsp;such a failure wouldn&#39;t jepordize their personal survival. For us, if we neglect those who are still sick,&nbsp;there is unremitting danger to our own lives and sanity. Under these complusions of selfpresvervation, duty, and love, it is not strange that our Society has concluded that it has but one high&nbsp;mission--to carry the A.A. message to those who don&#39;t know there&#39;s a way out.</span></span></div>

Decidedly unfriendly, he stared at me out of eyes that&nbsp;were slits in a swollen red face. I had to agree with the doctor--he certainly didn&#39;t look good. But I told&nbsp;him my own story. What a wonderful Fellowship we had, how well we understood each other. I bore&nbsp;down hard on the hopelessness of a drunk&#39;s dilemma. I insisted that few drunks could ever get well ontheir own steam, but that in our groups we could do together what we could not do separately. He&nbsp;interrupted to scoff at this and asserted he&#39;d fix his wife, his partner, and his alcoholism by himself.&nbsp;Sarcastically he asked, &quot;How much does your scheme cost?&quot;</span></span></div>
