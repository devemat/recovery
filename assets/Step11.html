												<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">PRAYER and meditation are our principal means of conscious contact with God.&nbsp;We A.A.&#39;s are active folk, enjoying the satisfactions of dealing with the realities of life, usually for the&nbsp;first time in our lives, and strenuously trying to help the next alcoholic who comes along. So it isn&#39;t&nbsp;surprising that we often tend to slight serious meditation and prayer as something not really&nbsp;necessary. To be sure, we feel it is something that might help us to meet an occasional emergency,&nbsp;but at first many of us are apt to regard it as a somewhat mysterious skill of clergymen, from which&nbsp;we may hope to get a secondhand benefit. Or perhaps we don&#39;t believe in these things at all.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

Those of us who once felt this way can certainly understand and&nbsp;sympathize. We well remember how something deep inside us kept rebelling against the idea of&nbsp;bowing before any God. Many of us had strong logic, too,</span></span></div>

What about all those&nbsp;unhappy lives which were the direct result of unfortunate birth and uncontrollable circumstances?&nbsp;Surely there could be no justice in this scheme of things, and therefore no God at all.</span></span></div>

												&nbsp;</div>
											<div id="cke_pastebin">
												<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Sometimes we took a slightly different tack. Sure, we said to ourselves, the hen probably did come&nbsp;before the egg. No doubt the universe had a &quot;first cause&quot; of some sort, the God of the Atom, maybe,&nbsp;hot and cold by turns. But certainly there wasn&#39;t any evidence of a God who knew or cared about&nbsp;human beings. We liked A.A. all right, and were quick to say that it had done miracles. But we&nbsp;recoiled from meditation and prayer as obstinately as the scientist who refused to perform a certain&nbsp;experiment lest it prove his pet theory wrong. Of course we finally did experiment, and when&nbsp;unexpected results followed, we felt different; in fact we knew different; and so we were sold on&nbsp;meditation and prayer. And that, we have found, can happen to anybody who tries. It has been well&nbsp;said that &quot;almost the only scoffers at prayer are those who never tried it enough.&quot;</span></span></div>

And for the same reason. When we refuse air, light, or food, the body&nbsp;suffers. And when we turn away from meditation and prayer, we likewise deprive our minds, our&nbsp;emotions, and our intuitions of vitally needed support. As the body can fail its purpose for lack of&nbsp;nourishment, so can the soul. We all need the light of God&#39;s reality, the nourishment of His strength,&nbsp;and the atmosphere of His</span></span></div>

To an amazing extent the facts of A.A. life confirm this ageless truth.&nbsp;There is a direct linkage among self-examination, meditation, and prayer. Taken separately, these&nbsp;practices can bring much relief and benefit. But when they are logically related and interwoven, the&nbsp;result is an unshakable foundation for life. Now and then we may be granted a glimpse of that&nbsp;ultimate reality which is God&#39;s kingdom. And we will be comforted and assured that our own destiny&nbsp;in that realm will be secure for so long as we try, however falteringly, to find and do the will of our&nbsp;own Creator.</span></span></div>

											<div id="cke_pastebin">
												<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">As we have seen, self-searching is the means by which we bring new vision, action, and grace to bear&nbsp;upon the dark and negative side of our natures. It is a step in the development of that kind ofhumility that makes it possible for us to receive God&#39;s help. Yet it is only a step. We will want to go&nbsp;further.</span></span></div>

How, then, shall we meditate?&nbsp;</span></span></div>

												<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">The actual experience of meditation and prayer across the centuries is, of course, immense.

												&nbsp;</div>
											<div id="cke_pastebin">
												<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Well, we might start like this. First let&#39;s look at a really good prayer. We won&#39;t have far to seek; the&nbsp;great men and women of all religions have left us a wonderful supply. Here let us consider one that is&nbsp;a classic.&nbsp;</span></span></div>
											<div>
												&nbsp;</div>
											<div>
												<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Its author was a man who for several hundred years now has been rated as a saint. We won&#39;t be&nbsp;biased or scared off by that fact, because although he was not an alcoholic he did, like us, go through&nbsp;the emotional wringer. And as he came out the other side of that painful experience, this prayer was&nbsp;his expression of what he could then see, feel, and wish to become:&nbsp;</span></span></div>
											<div>
												&nbsp;</div>
											<div>
												<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">&quot;Lord, make me a channel of thy peace--that where there is hatred, I may bring love--that where&nbsp;there is wrong, I may bring the spirit of forgiveness--that where there is discord, I may bring&nbsp;harmony--that where there is error, I may bring truth--that where there is doubt, I may bring faith-&nbsp;-that where there is despair, I may bring hope--that where there are shadows, I may bring light--&nbsp;that where there is sadness, I may bring joy. Lord, grant that I may seek rather to comfort than to be&nbsp;comforted--to understand, than to be understood--to love, than to be loved. For it is by selfforgetting that one finds. It is by forgiving that one is forgiven. It is by dying that one awakens to&nbsp;Eternal Life. Amen.&quot;</span></span></div>

												&nbsp;</div>
											<div id="cke_pastebin">
												<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">As beginners in meditation, we might now reread this prayer several times very slowly, savoring&nbsp;every word and trying to take in the deep meaning of each phrase and idea.</span></span></div>

											<div>
												<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">It will help if we can drop&nbsp;all resistance to what our friend says. For in meditation, debate has no place. We rest quietly with the&nbsp;thoughts of someone who knows, so that we may experience and learn.</span></span></div>
											<div>
												&nbsp;</div>
											<div id="cke_pastebin">
												<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">As though lying upon a sunlit beach, let us relax and breathe deeply of the spiritual atmosphere with&nbsp;which the grace of this prayer surrounds us. Let us become willing to partake and be strengthened&nbsp;and lifted up by the sheer spiritual power, beauty, and love of which these magnificent words are the&nbsp;carriers. Let us look now upon the sea and ponder what its mystery is; and let us lift our eyes to the&nbsp;far horizon, beyond which we shall seek all those wonders still unseen.</span></span></div>

												<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">&quot;Shucks!&quot; says somebody. &quot;This is nonsense. It isn&#39;t practical.&quot;</span></span></div>

												&nbsp;</div>
											<div>
												<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">When such thoughts break in, we&nbsp;might recall, a little ruefully, how much store we used to set by imagination as it tried to create reality&nbsp;out of bottles. Yes, we reveled in that sort of thinking, didn&#39;t we? And though sober nowadays, don&#39;t&nbsp;we often try to do much the same thing? Perhaps our trouble was not that we used our imagination.&nbsp;Perhaps the real trouble was our almost total inability to point imagination toward the right&nbsp;objectives. There&#39;s nothing the matter with constructive imagination; all sound achievement rests&nbsp;upon it. After all, no man can build a house until he first envisions a plan for it. Well, meditation is like&nbsp;that, too; it helps to envision our spiritual objective before we try to move toward it. So let&#39;s get back&nbsp;to that sunlit beach--or to the plains or to the mountains, if you prefer.</span></span></div>

												&nbsp;</div>
											<div id="cke_pastebin">
												<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Once more we read our prayer, and again try to see what its inner essence is. We&#39;ll think now about&nbsp;the man who first uttered the prayer. First of all, he wanted to become a &quot;channel.&quot; Then he asked&nbsp;for the grace to bring love, forgiveness, harmony, truth, faith, hope, light, and joy to every humanbeing he could.</span></span></div>
											<div>
												&nbsp;</div>
											<div id="cke_pastebin">
												<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Next came the expression of an aspiration and a hope for himself. He hoped, God willing, that he&nbsp;might be able to find some of these treasures, too. This he would try to do by what he called selfforgetting. What did he mean by &quot;self- forgetting,&quot; and how did he propose to accomplish that?</span></span></div>
											<div>
												&nbsp;</div>
											<div id="cke_pastebin">
												<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">He thought it better to give comfort than to receive it; better to understand than to be understood;&nbsp;better to forgive than to be forgiven.</span></span></div>

												&nbsp;</div>
											<div id="cke_pastebin">
												<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">This much could be a fragment of what is called meditation, perhaps our very first attempt at a mood,&nbsp;a flier into the realm of spirit, if you like. It ought to be followed by a good look at where we stand&nbsp;now, and a further look at what might happen in our lives were we able to move closer to the ideal we&nbsp;have been trying to glimpse. Meditation is something which can always be further developed. It has&nbsp;no boundaries, either of width or height. Aided by such instruction and example as we can find, it is&nbsp;essentially an individual adventure, something which each one of us works out in his own way. But its&nbsp;object is always the same: to improve our conscious contact with God, with His grace, wisdom, and&nbsp;love. And let&#39;s always remember that meditation is in reality intensely practical. One of its first fruits&nbsp;</span></span></div>

											<div>
												&nbsp;</div>
											<div id="cke_pastebin">
												<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Now, what of prayer? Prayer is the raising of the heart and mind to God--and in this sense it includes&nbsp;meditation. How may we go about it? And how does it fit in with meditation? Prayer, as commonly&nbsp;understood, is a petition to God. Having opened our channel as best we can, we try to ask for those&nbsp;right things of which we and others are in the greatest need. And we think that the whole range of our&nbsp;needs is well defined by that part of Step Eleven which says: &quot;. . . knowledge of His will for us and the&nbsp;power to carry that out.&quot; A request for this fits in any part of our day.</span></span></div>
											<div>
												&nbsp;</div>
											<div id="cke_pastebin">
												<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">In the morning we think of the hours to come. Perhaps we think of our day&#39;s work and the chances it&nbsp;may afford us to be useful and helpful, or of some special problem that it may bring. Possibly today&nbsp;will see a continuation of a serious and as yet unresolved problem left over from yesterday. Our&nbsp;immediate temptation will be to ask for specific solutions to specific problems, and for the ability to&nbsp;help other people as we have already thought they should be helped. In that case, we are asking God&nbsp;to do it our way. Therefore, we ought to consider each request carefully to see what its real merit is.&nbsp;Even so, when making specific requests, it will be well to add to each one of them this qualification: &quot;. .&nbsp;. if it be Thy will.&quot; We ask simply that throughout the day God place in us the best understanding of&nbsp;His will that we can have for that day, and that we be given the grace by which we may carry it out.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

												<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">be met and decisions made, and renew the&nbsp;simple request: &quot;Thy will, not mine, be done.&quot; If at these points our emotional disturbance happens to&nbsp;be great, we will more surely keep our balance, provided we remember, and repeat to ourselves, a&nbsp;particular prayer or phrase that has appealed to us in our reading or meditation. Just saying it over&nbsp;and over will often enable us to clear a channel choked up with anger, fear, frustration, or&nbsp;misunderstanding, and permit us to return to the surest help of all--our search for God&#39;s will, not our&nbsp;own, in the moment of stress. At these critical moments, if we remind ourselves that &quot;it is better to&nbsp;comfort than to be comforted, to understand than to be understood, to love than to be loved,&quot; we will&nbsp;be following the intent of Step Eleven.</span></span></div>
											<div>
												&nbsp;</div>
											<div id="cke_pastebin">
												<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Of course, it is reasonable and understandable that the question is often asked: &quot;Why can&#39;t we take a&nbsp;specific and troubling dilemma straight to God, and in prayer secure from Him sure and definite&nbsp;answers to our requests?&quot;</span></span></div>
											<div>
												&nbsp;</div>
											<div id="cke_pastebin">
												<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">This can be done, but it has hazards. We have seen A.A.&#39;s ask with much earnestness and faith for&nbsp;God&#39;s explicit guidance on matters ranging all the way from a shattering domestic or financial crisis to&nbsp;correcting a minor personal fault, like tardiness. Quite often, however, the thoughts that seem to&nbsp;come from God are not answers at all. They prove to be well-intentioned unconscious rationalizations.&nbsp;The A.A., or indeed any man, who tries to run his life rigidly by this kind of prayer, by this selfserving demand of God for replies, is a particularly disconcerting individual. To any questioning orcriticism of his actions he instantly proffers his reliance upon prayer for guidance in all matters great&nbsp;or</span></span></div>

He may have forgotten the possibility that his own wishful thinking and the human tendency&nbsp;to rationalize have distorted his so-called guidance. With the best of intentions, he tends to force his&nbsp;own will into all sorts of situations and problems with the comfortable assurance that he is acting&nbsp;under God&#39;s specific direction. Under such an illusion, he can of course create great havoc without in&nbsp;the least intending it.</span></span></div>
											<div>
												&nbsp;</div>
											<div id="cke_pastebin">
												<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">We also fall into another similar temptation. We form ideas as to what we think God&#39;s will is for other&nbsp;people. We say to ourselves, &quot;This one ought to be cured of his fatal malady,&quot; or &quot;That one ought to&nbsp;be relieved of his emotional pain,&quot; and we pray for these specific things. Such prayers, of course, are&nbsp;fundamentally good acts, but often they are based upon a supposition that we know God&#39;s will for the&nbsp;person for whom we pray. This means that side by side with an earnest prayer there can be a certain&nbsp;amount of presumption and conceit in us. It is A.A.&#39;s experience that particularly in these cases we&nbsp;ought to pray that God&#39;s will, whatever it is, be done for others as well as for ourselves.&nbsp;</span></span></div>
											<div>
												&nbsp;</div>
											<div>
												<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">In A.A. we have found that the actual good results of prayer are beyond question. They are matters&nbsp;of knowledge and experience. All those who have persisted have found strength not ordinarily their&nbsp;own. They have found wisdom beyond their usual capability. And they have increasingly found a&nbsp;peace of mind which can stand firm in the face of difficult circumstances.</span></span></div>
											<div>
												&nbsp;</div>
											<div id="cke_pastebin">
												<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">We discover that we do receive guidance for our lives to just about the extent that we stop making&nbsp;demands upon God to give it to us on order and on our terms.

He will also report that out of every season of grief or suffering, when the&nbsp;hand of God seemed heavy or even unjust, new lessons for living were learned, new resources of&nbsp;courage were uncovered, and that finally, inescapably, the conviction came that God does &quot;move in a&nbsp;mysterious way His wonders to perform.&quot;</span></span></div>
											<div>
												&nbsp;</div>
											<div id="cke_pastebin">
												<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">All this should be very encouraging news for those who recoil from prayer because they don&#39;t believe&nbsp;in it, or because they feel themselves cut off from God&#39;s help and direction. All of us, without&nbsp;exception, pass through times when we can pray only with the greatest exertion of will. Occasionally&nbsp;we go even further than this. We are seized with a rebellion so sickening that we simply won&#39;t pray.&nbsp;When these things happen we should not think too ill of ourselves. We should simply resume prayer&nbsp;as soon as we can, doing what we know to be good for us.</span></span></div>

												&nbsp;</div>
											<div id="cke_pastebin">
												<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Perhaps one of the greatest rewards of meditation and prayer is the sense of <em>belonging</em> that comes to&nbsp;us. We no longer live in a completely hostile world. We are no longer lost and frightened and&nbsp;purposeless. The moment we catch even a glimpse of God&#39;s will, the moment we begin to see truth,&nbsp;justice, and love as the real and eternal things in life, we are no longer deeply disturbed by all the&nbsp;seeming evidence to the contrary that surrounds us in purely human affairs. We know that God&nbsp;lovingly watches over us. We know that when we turn to Him, all will be well with us, here and&nbsp;hereafter.&nbsp;</span></span></div>
