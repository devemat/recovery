										<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">GOOD judgment, a careful sense of timing, courage, and prudence---these are the qualities we shall&nbsp;need when we take step Nine.</span></span></div>

										<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">After we made a list of the people we have harmed, we have reflected carefully upon each instance,&nbsp;and we have tried to possess ourselves of the right attitude in which to proceed, we will see that the&nbsp;making of direct amends, divides those we should approach into several classes. There will be those&nbsp;who ought to be dealt with just as soon as we become reasonably confident we can maintain our&nbsp;sobriety. There will be other cases where action ought to be deferred, and still others in which by the&nbsp;very nature of the situation we shall never be able to make direct personal contact at all.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

										<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Most of us begin making certain kinds of direct amends from the day we join Alcoholics Anonymous.&nbsp;The moment we tell our families that we are really to try the program, the process has begun. In this&nbsp;area there are seldom any questions of timing or caution. We want to come in the door shouting the&nbsp;good news. After coming from our first meeting, or perhaps after we have finished reading the book&nbsp;</span></span></div>

										<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous,&quot; we usually want to sit down with some member of the family and readily&nbsp;admit the damage we have done by our drinking. Almost always we want to go further and admit&nbsp;other defects that have made us hard to live with. This will be a very different occasion, and in sharp&nbsp;contrast with those hangover mornings when we alternated between reviling ourselves and blaming&nbsp;the family (and everyone else) for our troubles. At this first sitting, it is necessary only that we make&nbsp;a general admission of our defects. It may be unwise at this stage to rehash certain harrowing&nbsp;episodes. Good judgment will suggest that we ought to take our time. While we may be quite willing&nbsp;to reveal the very worst, we must be sure to remember that we cannot buy our own peace of mind at&nbsp;the expense of others.</span></span></div>

										&nbsp;</div>
									<div id="cke_pastebin">
										<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Much the same approach will apply at the office or factory. We shall at once think of a few people who&nbsp;know all about our drinking, and who have been most affected by it. But even in these cases, we may&nbsp;need to use a little more discretion than we did with the family. We may not want to say anything for&nbsp;several weeks, or longer. First we will wish to be reasonably certain that wee are on the A.A. beam.&nbsp;Then we are ready to go to these people, to tell them what A.A. is, and what we are trying to do.&nbsp;Against this background we can freely admit the damage we have done and make our apologies. We&nbsp;can pay, or promise to pay, whatever obligations, financial institutions or otherwise, we owe. The&nbsp;generous response of most people to such quiet sincerity will often astonish us. Even our severest and&nbsp;most justified critics will frequently meet us more than halfway on the first trial.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

										<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">This atmosphere of approval and praise is apt to be so exhilarating as to put us off balance by&nbsp;creating an insatiable appetite for more of the same. Or we may be tipped over in the other direction&nbsp;when, in rare cases, we get a cool and skeptical reception. This will tempt us to argue, or to press our&nbsp;point insistently. Or maybe it will tempt us to discouragement and pessimism. But if we have&nbsp;prepared ourselves well in advance, such reactions will not deflect us from our steady and even&nbsp;purpose.</span></span></div>

										<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">After taking this preliminary trial at making amends, we may enjoy such a sense of relief that we&nbsp;conclude our task is finished. We will want to rest on our laurels. The temptation to skip the more&nbsp;humiliating and dreaded meetings that still remain may be great. We will often manufacture plausible&nbsp;excuses for dodging these issues entirely. Or we may just procrastinate, telling ourselves the time is&nbsp;not yet, when in reality we have already passed up many a fine chance to right a serious wrong. Let&sup1;s&nbsp;not talk prudence while practicing evasion.</span></span></div>

										<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">As soon as we begin to feel confident in our new way of life we have begun, by our behavior and&nbsp;example, to convince those about us that we are indeed changing for the better, it is usually safe to&nbsp;talk in complete frankness with those who have been seriously affected, even those who may be a&nbsp;little or not at all aware of what we have done to them. The only exceptions we will make will be cases&nbsp;where our disclosure would cause actual harm. These conversations can begin in a casual or natural&nbsp;way. But if no such opportunity presents itself, at some point we will want to summon all our courage,&nbsp;head straight for the person </span></span></div>

We needn&#39;t wallow in&nbsp;excessive remorse before those we harmed, but amends at this level should be forthright and&nbsp;generous.</span></span></div>

										&nbsp;</div>
									<div id="cke_pastebin">
										<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">There can only be one consideration which should qualify our desire for a complete disclosure of the&nbsp;damage we have done. That will arise in the occasional situation where to make a full revelation&nbsp;would seriously harm the one to who we are making amends. Or---quite as important---other&nbsp;people. We cannot, for example unload a detailed account of extramarital adventuring upon the&nbsp;shoulders of our unsuspecting wife or husband. And even in those cases where such a matter must be&nbsp;discussed, let&sup1;s try to avoid harming third parties, whoever they may be. It does not lighten our&nbsp;burden when we recklessly make the crosses of others heavier.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

										<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Many a razor-edged question can arise in other departments of life where the same principle is&nbsp;involved. Suppose, for instance, that we have drunk up a good chunk of our firm&sup1;s money, whether&nbsp;by &sup3;borrowing&sup2; or on a heavily padded expense account. Suppose that this may continue to go&nbsp;undetected, if we say nothing. Do we instantly confess our irregularities to the firm, in the practical&nbsp;certainty that we will be fired and become unemployable? Are we going to be so rigidly righteous&nbsp;about making amends that we don&sup1;t care what happens to the family or home? Or do we first consult&nbsp;those who are to be gravely affected? Do we lay the matter before our sponsor or spiritual adviser,&nbsp;earnestly asking God&sup1;s help and guidance---meanwhile resolving to do the right thing when it&nbsp;becomes clear, cost </span></span></div>

Of course, there is no pat answer which can fit all such dilemmas.&nbsp;But all of them do require a complete willingness to make amends as fast and as far as may be&nbsp;possible in a given set of conditions.</span></span></div>

										&nbsp;</div>
									<div id="cke_pastebin">
										<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Above all, we should try to be absolutely sure that we are not delaying because we are afraid. For the&nbsp;readiness to take the full consequences of our past acts, and to take responsibility for the well-being&nbsp;of others at the same time, is the very spirit of Step Nine.</span></span></div>
