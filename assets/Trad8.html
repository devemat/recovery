						<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS will never have a professional class. We have gained some&nbsp;understanding of the ancient words &quot;Freely ye have received, freely give.&quot; We have discovered that&nbsp;at the point of professionalism, money and spirituality do not mix. Almost no recovery from&nbsp;alcoholism has ever been brought about by the world&#39;s best professionals, whether medical or&nbsp;religious. We do not decry professionalism in other fields, but we accept the sober fact that it does not&nbsp;work for us. Every time we have tried to professionalize our Twelfth Step, the result has been exactly&nbsp;the same: Our single purpose has been defeated.</span></span></div>

					<div id="cke_pastebin">
						<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Alcoholics simply will not listen to a paid twelfth-stepper. Almost from the beginning, we have been&nbsp;positive that face-to-face work with the alcoholic who suffers could be based only on the desire to help&nbsp;and be helped. When an A.A. talks for money, whether at a meeting or to a single newcomer, it can&nbsp;have a very bad effect on him, too. The money motive compromises him and everything he says and&nbsp;does for his prospect. This has always been so obvious that only a very few A.A.&#39;s have ever worked&nbsp;the Twelfth Step for a fee.</span></span></div>

						<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Fellowship than professionalism. Caretakers who swept floors, cooks who fried&nbsp;hamburgers, secretaries in offices, authors writing books-all these we have seen hotly assailed&nbsp;because they were, as their critics angrily remarked, &quot;making money out of A.A.&quot; Ignoring the fact&nbsp;that these labors were not Twelfth Step jobs at all, the critics attacked as A.A. professionals these&nbsp;workers of ours who were often doing thankless tasks that no one else could or would do. Even&nbsp;greater furors were provoked when A.A. members began to run rest homes and farms for alcoholics,&nbsp;when some hired out to corporations as personnel men in charge of the alcoholic problem in industry,&nbsp;when some became nurses on alcoholic wards, when others entered the field of alcohol education. In&nbsp;all these instances, and more, it was claimed that A.A. knowledge and experience were being sold for&nbsp;money, hence these people, too, were professionals.</span></span></div>

						&nbsp;</div>
					<div id="cke_pastebin">
						<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">At last, however, a plain line of cleavage could be seen between professionalism and&nbsp;nonprofessionalism. When we had agreed that the Twelfth Step couldn&#39;t be sold for money, we had&nbsp;been wise. But when we had declared that our Fellowship couldn&#39;t hire service workers nor could any&nbsp;A.A. member carry our knowledge into other fields, we were taking the counsel of fear, fear which&nbsp;today has been largely dispelled in the light of experience.</span></span></div>

						<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Take the case of the club janitor and cook. If a club is going to function, it has to be habitable and&nbsp;hospitable. We tried volunteers, who were quickly disenchanted with sweeping floors and brewing&nbsp;coffee seven days a week. They just didn&#39;t show up. Even more important, an empty club couldn&#39;t&nbsp;answer its telephone, but it was an open invitation </span></span></div>

If we hired an alcoholic, he&#39;d receive only what we&#39;d&nbsp;have to pay a non-alcoholic for the same job. The job was not to do Twelfth Step work; it was to make&nbsp;Twelfth Step work possible. It was a service proposition, pure and simple.</span></span></div>

						<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Neither could A.A. itself function without full-time workers. At the Foundation&nbsp;and intergroup offices, we couldn&#39;t&nbsp;employ non alcoholics as secretaries; we had to have people who knew the A.A. pitch. But the minute&nbsp;we hired them, the ultraconservative and fearful ones shrilled, &quot;Professionalism!&quot; At one period, thestatus of these faithful servants was almost unbearable. They weren&#39;t asked to speak at A.A. meetings&nbsp;because they were &quot;making money out of A.A.&quot; At times, they were actually shunned by fellow&nbsp;members. Even the charitably disposed described them as &quot;a necessary evil.&quot; Committees took full&nbsp;advantage of this attitude to depress their salaries. They could regain some measure of virtue, it was&nbsp;thought, if they worked for A.A. real cheap. These notions persisted for years. Then we saw that if a&nbsp;hardworking secretary answered the phone dozens of times a day, listened to twenty wailing wives,&nbsp;arranged hospitalization and got sponsorship for ten newcomers, and was gently diplomatic with the&nbsp;irate drunk who complained about the job she was doing and how she was overpaid, then such a&nbsp;person could surely not be called a professional A.A. She was not professionalizing the Twelfth Step;&nbsp;she was just </span></span></div>

She was helping to give the man coming in the door the break he&nbsp;ought to have. Volunteer committeemen and assistants could be of great help, but they could not be&nbsp;expected to carry this load day in and day out.</span></span></div>

						<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">At the Foundation, the same story repeats itself. Eight tons of books and literature per month do not&nbsp;package and channel themselves all over the world. Sacks of letters on every conceivable A.A.&nbsp;problem ranging from a lonely-heart Eskimo to the growing pains of thousands of groups must be&nbsp;answered by people who know. Right contacts with the world outside have to be maintained. A.A.&#39;s&nbsp;lifelines have to be tended. So we hire A.A. staff members. We pay them well, and they earn what&nbsp;they get. They are professional secretaries&nbsp;but they certainly are not professional&nbsp;A.A.&#39;s. Perhaps the fear will always lurk in every A.A. heart that one day our name will be exploited&nbsp;by somebody for real cash. Even the suggestion of such a thing never fails to whip up a hurricane, and&nbsp;we have discovered that hurricanes have a way of mauling with equal severity both the just and the&nbsp;unjust. They are always unreasonable.</span></span></div>

						<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">No individuals have been more buffeted by such emotional gusts than those A.A.&#39;s bold enough to&nbsp;accept employment with outside agencies dealing with the alcohol problem. A university wanted an&nbsp;A.A. member to educate the public on alcoholism. A corporation wanted a personnel </span></span></div>

A state drunk farm wanted a manager who could really handle inebriates. A city wanted&nbsp;an experienced social worker who understood what alcohol could do to a family. A state alcohol&nbsp;commission wanted a paid researcher. These are only a few of the jobs which A.A. members as&nbsp;individuals have been asked to fill. Now and then, A.A. members have bought farms or rest homes&nbsp;where badly beat-up topers could find needed care. The question was--and sometimes still is--are&nbsp;such activities to be branded as professionalism under A.A. tradition?</span></span></div>

						&nbsp;</div>
					<div id="cke_pastebin">
						<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">We think the answer is &quot;No. Members who select such full-time careers do not professionalize A.A.&#39;s&nbsp;Twelfth Step.&quot; The road to this conclusion was long and rocky. At first, we couldn&#39;t see the real issue&nbsp;involved. In former days, the moment an A.A. hired out to such enterprises, he was immediately&nbsp;tempted to use the name Alcoholics Anonymous for publicity or money-raising purposes. Drunk&nbsp;farms, educational ventures, state legislatures, and commissions advertised the fact that A.A.&nbsp;members served them. Unthinkingly, A.A.&#39;s so employed recklessly broke anonymity to thump the&nbsp;tub or their pet enterprise. For this reason, some very good causes and all connected with them&nbsp;suffered unjust criticism from A.A. groups. More often than not, these onslaughts were spearheaded&nbsp;by the cry &quot;Professionalism! That guy is making money out of A.A.!&quot; Yet not a single one of them had&nbsp;been hired to do A.A.&#39;s Twelfth Step work. The violation in these instances was not professionalism at&nbsp;all; it was breaking anonymity. A.A.&#39;s sole purpose was being compromised, and the name of&nbsp;Alcoholics Anonymous was being misused.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

						<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">It is significant, now that almost no A.A. in our Fellowship breaks anonymity at the public level, that&nbsp;nearly all these fears have subsided. We see that we have no right or need to discourage A.A.&#39;s who&nbsp;wish to work as individuals in these wider fields. It would be actually antisocial were we to forbid&nbsp;them. We cannot declare A.A. such a closed corporation that we keep our knowledge and experience&nbsp;top secret. If an A.A. member acting as a citizen can become a better researcher, educator, personnel&nbsp;officer, then why not? Everybody gains, and we have lost nothing. True, some of the projects to which&nbsp;A.A.&#39;s have attached themselves have been ill-conceived, but that makes not the slightest difference&nbsp;with the principle involved.</span></span></div>
