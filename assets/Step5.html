						<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">ALL of A.A.&#39;s Twelve Steps ask us to go contrary to our natural desires... They all deflate our egos.&nbsp;When it comes to ego deflation, few steps are harder to take than Five. But scarcely any Step is more&nbsp;necessary for longtime sobriety and peace of mind than this one.</span></span></div>

						&nbsp;</div>
					<div>
						<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">A.A. experience has taught us that we cannot live alone with our pressing problems and the character&nbsp;defects which cause or aggravate them. If we have swept the searchlight of Step Four back and forth&nbsp;over our careers, and it has revealed in stark relief those experiences we&#39;d rather not remember, if&nbsp;we have come to know how wrong thinking and action have hurt us and others, then the need to quit&nbsp;living by ourselves with those tormenting ghosts of yesterday gets more urgent than ever. We have&nbsp;to talk to some body about them.</span></span></div>

					<div id="cke_pastebin">
						<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">So intense, though, is our fear and reluctance to do this, that many A.A.&#39;s at first try to bypass Step&nbsp;Five. We search for an easier way--which usually consists of the general and fairly painless admission&nbsp;that when drinking we were sometimes bad actors. Then for good measure, we add dramatic&nbsp;descriptions of that part of our drinking behavior which our friends probably know about anyhow.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

Certain distressing or&nbsp;humiliating memories, we tell ourselves, ought not be shared with anyone. These will remain our&nbsp;secret. not a soul must ever know. We hope they&#39;ll go to the grave with us.&nbsp;</span></span></div>
					<div>
						&nbsp;</div>
					<div>
						<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Yet if A.A.&#39;s experience means anything at all, this is not only unwise, but is actually a perilious&nbsp;resolve. Few muddled attitudes have caused us more trouble than holding back on Step Five. Some&nbsp;people are unable to stay sober at all; others will relapse periodically until they really clean house.&nbsp;Even A.A. oldtimers, sober for years, pay dearly for skimping on this Step. they will tell how they&nbsp;tried to carry the load alone; how much they suffered of irritability, anxiety, remorse, depression;&nbsp;and how, unconsciously seeking relief, they would sometimes accuse even their best friends of the&nbsp;very character defects they themselves were trying to conceal. They always discovered that relief&nbsp;never came by confessing the sins of other people. Everybody had to confess his own.</span></span></div>

					<div id="cke_pastebin">
						<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">This practice of admitting one&#39;s defects to another person is, of course, very ancient. It has&nbsp;been validated in every century, and it characterizes the lives of all spiritually centered and truly&nbsp;religious people. But today religion is by no means the sole advocate of this saving principle.&nbsp;Psychatrists and psychologists point out the deep need every human being has for practical insight&nbsp;and knowledge of his own personality flaws, and for a discussion of them with an understanding and&nbsp;trustworthy person. So far as alcoholics are concerned A.A. would go even further. Most of us would&nbsp;declare that without a fearless admission of our defects to another human being we could not stay&nbsp;</span></span></div>

						&nbsp;</div>
					<div id="cke_pastebin">
						<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">What are we likely to recieve from Step Five? For one thing, we shall get rid of that terrible sense of&nbsp;isolation we&#39;ve always had. Almost without exception, alcoholics are tortured by loneliness. Even&nbsp;before our drinking got bad and people cut us off, nearly all of us suffered the feeling we didn&#39;t quite&nbsp;belong. Either we were shy and dared not draw near others, or we were apt to be noisy good fellows&nbsp;craving attention and companionship, but never getting it--at least to our way of thinking. There was&nbsp;always that mysterious barrier we could neither surrmount nor understand. It was as if we were&nbsp;actors on a stage, suddenly realizing we did not know a single lines of our parts. That&#39;s one reason weloved alcohol too well. It did let us act extemporaneously. But even Bacchus boomeranged on us; we&nbsp;were finally struck down and left in terrified loneliness.</span></span></div>
					<div>
						&nbsp;</div>
					<div id="cke_pastebin">
						<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">When we reached A.A., and for the first time in our lives stood amoung people who seemed to&nbsp;understand, the sense of belonging was tremendously exciting. We thought the isolation problem had&nbsp;been solved. But we soon discovered that while we weren&#39;t alone any more in a moral sense, we still&nbsp;suffered the pangs of anxious apartness. Until we had talked with complete candor of our conflicts,&nbsp;and had listened to someone else do the same thing, we still didn&#39;t belong. Step Five was the answer.&nbsp;It was the beginning of true kinship with man and God.</span></span></div>

						<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">get the feeling that we could be forgiven, no&nbsp;matter what we had thought or done. Often it was while working on this Step with our sponsors or&nbsp;spiritual advisors that we first felt truly able to forgive others, no matter how deeply we felt they had&nbsp;wronged us. Our moral inventory had persuaded us that all-round forgiveness was desirable, but it&nbsp;was only when we resolutely tackled Step Five that we inwardly knew we&#39;d be able to recieve&nbsp;forgiveness and give it, too.</span></span></div>
					<div>
						&nbsp;</div>
					<div id="cke_pastebin">
						<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Another great dividend we may expect from confiding our defects to another human being is&nbsp;humility--a word often misunderstood. To those who have made progress in A.A., it amounts to a&nbsp;clear recognition of what and who we really are, followed by sincere attempt to become what we could&nbsp;be. Therefore, our first practical move toward humility must consist of recognizing our deficiencies.&nbsp;No defect can be corrected unless we clearly see what it is. But we shall have to do more than see.&nbsp;The objective look at ourselves we took in Step Four was, after all, only a look. All of us saw, for&nbsp;example, that we lacked honesty and tolerance, that we were beset at times by attacks of of self-pity&nbsp;or delusions of personal grandeur. But while this was a humiliating experience, it didn&#39;t necessarily&nbsp;mean that we had yet acquired much actual humility. Though now recogized, our defects were still&nbsp;there. Something had to be done about them. And we soon found that we could not wish them away&nbsp;or will them away by ourselves.</span></span></div>
					<div>
						&nbsp;</div>
					<div id="cke_pastebin">
						<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">More realism and therefore more honesty about ourselves are the great gains we make under the&nbsp;influence of Step Five. As we took inventory, we began to suspect how much trouble self-delusion had&nbsp;been causing us. This had brought</span></span></div>

					</div>
					<div>
						<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">a disturbing reflection. If all our lives we had more or less fooled&nbsp;ourselves, how could we be so sure we weren&#39;t still self-decieved? How could we be certain we had&nbsp;made a true catalog of our defects and had really admitted them, even to ourselves? Because we were&nbsp;still bothered by fear, self-pity and and hurt feelings, it was probable we couldn&#39;t appraise ourselves&nbsp;fairly at all. too much guilt and remorse might cause us to dramatize and exaggerate our shorcomings.&nbsp;Or anger and hurt pride might be the smoke screen under which we were hiding some of our defects,&nbsp;while we blamed others for them. Possibly too, we were still handicapped by many liabilities, great&nbsp;and small, we never knew we had.</span></span></div>
					<div>
						&nbsp;</div>
					<div id="cke_pastebin">
						<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Hence it was most evident that a solitary self appraisal, and the admission of our defects based on&nbsp;that alone, wouldn&#39;t be nearly enough. We&#39;d have to have outside help if we were surely to know and&nbsp;admit the truth about ourselves--the help of God and another human being. Only by discussing&nbsp;ourselves, holding back nothing, only by being willing to take advice and and accept direction could we&nbsp;set foot on the road to straight thinking, solid honesty, and genuine humility.&nbsp;Yet many of us still clung back. We said, &quot;Why can&#39;t &#39;God as we understand him&#39; tell us where we are&nbsp;astray? If the Creator gave us our lives in the first place, then he must know in every detail where we&nbsp;have since gone wrong. Why don&#39;t we make our admissions to him directly? Why do we need to bring&nbsp;anyone else into this?&quot;</span></span></div>

						<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">At this stage the difficulties of trying to deal rightly with God by ourselves are twofold. Though we&nbsp;may at first be</span></span></div>

					</div>
					<div>
						<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">startled to realize that God knows all about us, we are apt to used that quite quickly.&nbsp;somehow being alone with God dosen&#39;t seem to be quite as embarrassing as facing up to another&nbsp;person. Until we actually sit down and talk aloud about what we have so long hidden, our willingness&nbsp;to clean house is still largely theoretical. When we are honest with another person, it confirms that we&nbsp;have been honest with ourselves and with God.The second difficulty is this: what comes to us alone may be garbled by our own rationalization and&nbsp;wishful thinking. The benefit of talking to another person is that we can get his direct comment and&nbsp;counsel on our situation, and there can be no doubt in our minds what that advice is. Going it alone in&nbsp;spiritual matters is dangerous. How many times have we heard well-intentioned people claimthe&nbsp;guidance of God when it was all too plain that they were sorely mistaken. Lacking both practice and&nbsp;humility, they had deluded themselves and were able to justify the most arrant nonsense on the&nbsp;ground that this was what God told them. It is worth noting that people of very high spiritual&nbsp;development almost always insist on checking with friends or spiritual advisors the guidance they feel&nbsp;they have received from God. Surely, then, an novice ought not lay himself open to the chance of&nbsp;making foolish, perhaps tragic blunders in this fashion. While the comment or advice of others may be&nbsp;by no means infallible, it is likely to be far more specific than any direct guidance we may receive&nbsp;while we are still so inexperienced in establishing contact with a Power greater than ourselves.</span></span></div>

						<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">we are to confide. Here we ought to take&nbsp;much care, remembering that prudence is a virtue which carries high rating. Perhaps we shall need to&nbsp;share with this person facts about ourselves which no other ought to know. We shall want to speak&nbsp;with someon who is experienced, who not only has stayed dry but has been able to surmount other&nbsp;serious difficulties. Difficulties, perhaps, like our own. this person may turn out to be one&#39;s&nbsp;sponsor,but not necessarily so. If you have developed a high confidence in him, and his temperament&nbsp;and problems are close to your own, then such a choice will be good. Besides, your sponsor already&nbsp;has the advantage of knowing something about your case.</span></span></div>

It may&nbsp;turn out, however, that you&#39;ll choose someone else for the more difficult and deeper revelations. This&nbsp;individual may be entirely outside of A.A.--for example, your clergyman or your doctor. For some of&nbsp;us a complete stranger may prove the best bet.</span></span></div>

						&nbsp;</div>
					<div id="cke_pastebin">
						<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">The real tests of the situation are your own willingness to confide and your full confidence in the one&nbsp;with whom you share your first accurate self-survey. Even when you&#39;ve found the person, it&nbsp;frequently takes great resolution to approach him or her. No one ought to say the A.A. program&nbsp;requires no willpower; here is one place you may require all you&#39;ve got. Happily, though, the chances&nbsp;are that you will be in for a very pleasent surprise. When your mission is carefully explained, and it is&nbsp;seen by the recipient of your confidence how helpful he can really be, the conversation</span></span></div>

Before long your listener may well tell a story or two about himself which&nbsp;will place you even more at ease. Provided you hold back nothing your sense of relief will mount from&nbsp;minute to minute. The damned up emotions of years break out of their confinement, and&nbsp;miraculously vanish as soon as they are exposed. As the pains subsides, a healing tranquility takes its&nbsp;place. And when humility and serenity are so combined, something else of great moment is apt to&nbsp;occur. Many an A.A., once agnostic or atheistic, tells us that it was at this stage of Step Five that he&nbsp;first actually felt the presence of God. And even those who had faith already often become conscious&nbsp;of God as they never were before.</span></span></div>
