										<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">THE spiritual substance of anonymity is sacrifice. Because A.A.&#39;s Twelve Traditions repeatedly ask us&nbsp;to give up personal desires for the common good, we realize that the sacrificial spirit--well symbolized&nbsp;by anonymity--is the foundation of them all. It is A.A.&#39;s proved willingness to make these sacrifices&nbsp;that gives people their high confidence in our future.</span></span></div>
									<div>
										&nbsp;</div>
									<div id="cke_pastebin">
										<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">But in the beginning, anonymity was not born of confidence; it was the child of our early fears. Our&nbsp;first nameless groups of alcoholics were secret societies. New prospects could find us only through a&nbsp;few trusted friends. The bare hint of publicity, even for our work, shocked us. Though ex-drinkers,&nbsp;we still thought we had to hide from public distrust and contempt.</span></span></div>

									<div id="cke_pastebin">
										<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">When the Big Book appeared in 1939, we called it &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous.&quot; Its foreword made this&nbsp;revealing statement: &quot;It is important that we remain anonymous because we are too few, at present,&nbsp;to handle the overwhelming number of personal appeals which may result from this publication. Being&nbsp;mostly business or professional folk, we could not well carry on our occupations in such an event.&quot;&nbsp;Between these lines, it is easy to read our fear that large</span></span></div>

										&nbsp;</div>
									<div id="cke_pastebin">
										<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">As the A.A. groups multiplied, so did anonymity problems. Enthusiastic over the spectacular recovery&nbsp;of a brother alcoholic, we&#39;d sometimes discuss those intimate and harrowing aspects of his case meant&nbsp;for his sponsor&#39;s ear alone. The aggrieved victim would then rightly declare that his trust had been&nbsp;broken. When such stories got into circulation outside of A.A., the loss of confidence in our anonymity&nbsp;promise was severe. It frequently turned people from us. Clearly, every A.A. member&#39;s name--and&nbsp;story, too--had to be confidential, if he wished. This was our first lesson in the practical application of&nbsp;anonymity.</span></span></div>
									<div>
										&nbsp;</div>
									<div id="cke_pastebin">
										<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">With characteristic intemperance, however, some of our newcomers cared not at all for secrecy. They&nbsp;wanted to shout A.A. from the housetops, and did. Alcoholics barely dry rushed about bright-eyed,&nbsp;buttonholing anyone who would listen to their stories. Others hurried to place themselves before&nbsp;microphones and cameras. Sometimes, they got distressingly drunk and let their groups down with a&nbsp;bang. They had changed from A.A. members into A.A. show-offs.</span></span></div>

										&nbsp;</div>
									<div id="cke_pastebin">
										<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">This phenomenon of contrast really set us thinking. Squarely before us was the question &quot;How&nbsp;anonymous should an A.A. member be?&quot; Our growth made it plain that we couldn&#39;t be a secret&nbsp;society, but it was equally plain that we couldn&#39;t be a vaudeville circuit, either. The charting of a safe&nbsp;path between these extremes took a long time.</span></span></div>

										&nbsp;</div>
									<div id="cke_pastebin">
										<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">As a rule, the average newcomer wanted his family to know immediately what he was trying to do. He&nbsp;also wanted</span></span></div>

										<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">to tell others who had tried to help him--his doctor, his minister, and close friends. As he&nbsp;gained confidence, he felt it right to explain his new way of life to his employer and business&nbsp;associates. When opportunities to be helpful came along, he found he could talk easily about A.A. to&nbsp;almost anyone. These quiet disclosures helped him to lose his fear of the alcoholic stigma, and spread&nbsp;the news of A.A.&#39;s existence in his community. Many a new man and woman came to A.A. because of&nbsp;such conversations. Though not in the strict letter of anonymity, such communications were well&nbsp;within its spirit.</span></span></div>
									<div>
										&nbsp;</div>
									<div>
										<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">But it became apparent that the word-of-mouth method was too limited. Our work, as such, needed&nbsp;to be publicized. The A.A. groups would have to reach quickly as many despairing alcoholics as they&nbsp;could. Consequently, many groups began to hold meetings which were open to interested friends and&nbsp;the public, so that the average citizen could see for himself just what A.A. was all about. The response&nbsp;to these meetings was warmly sympathetic. Soon, groups began to receive requests for A.A. speakers&nbsp;to appear before civic organizations, church groups, and medical societies. Provided anonymity was&nbsp;maintained on these platforms, and reporters present were cautioned against the use of names or&nbsp;pictures, the result was fine.</span></span></div>

										&nbsp;</div>
									<div id="cke_pastebin">
										<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Then came our first few excursions into major publicity, which were breathtaking. Cleveland&#39;s Plain&nbsp;Dealer articles about us ran that town&#39;s membership from a few into hundreds overnight. The news&nbsp;stories of Mr. Rockefeller&#39;s dinner for Alcoholics Anonymous helped double our total membership in a&nbsp;year&#39;s time. Jack Alexander&#39;s famous Saturday Evening Post piece made A.A. a national institu-</span></span></div>

										<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">tion.&nbsp;Such tributes as these brought opportunities for still more recognition. Other newspapers and&nbsp;magazines wanted A.A. stories. Film companies wanted to photograph us. Radio, and finally television,&nbsp;besieged us with requests for appearances. What should we do?</span></span></div>
									<div>
										&nbsp;</div>
									<div id="cke_pastebin">
										<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">As this tide offering top public approval swept in, we realized that it could do us incalculable good or&nbsp;great harm. Everything would depend upon how it was channeled. We simply couldn&#39;t afford to take&nbsp;the chance of letting self appointed members present themselves as messiahs representing A.A.&nbsp;before the whole public. The promoter instinct in us might be our undoing. If even one publicly got&nbsp;drunk, or was lured into using A.A.&#39;s name for his own purposes, the damage might be irreparable. At&nbsp;this altitude (press, radio, films, and television), anonymity--1OO percent anonymity--was the only&nbsp;possible answer. Here, principles would have to come before personalities, without exception.</span></span></div>

									<div id="cke_pastebin">
										<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">These experiences taught us that anonymity is real humility at work. It is an all-pervading spiritual&nbsp;quality which today keynotes A.A. life everywhere. Moved by the spirit of anonymity, we try to give&nbsp;up our natural desires for personal distinction as A.A. members both among fellow alcoholics and&nbsp;before the general public. As we lay aside these very human aspirations, we believe that each of us&nbsp;takes part in the weaving of a protective mantle which covers our whole Society and under which we&nbsp;may grow and work in unity.</span></span></div>

									<div id="cke_pastebin">
										<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">We are sure that humility, expressed by anonymity, is the greatest safeguard that Alcoholics&nbsp;Anonymous can ever have.</span></span></div>
