							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">&quot;THIS is the Step that separates the men from the boys.&quot; So declared a well-loved clergyman who&nbsp;happens to be one of A.A.&#39;s greatest friends. He goes on to explain that any person capable of enough&nbsp;willingness and honesty to try repeatedly Step Six on all his faults--without any reservations&nbsp;whatever--has indeed come a long way spiritually, and is therefore entitled to be called a man who is&nbsp;sincerely trying to grow in the image and likeness of his own Creator.</span></span></div>

							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Of course, the often disputed question of whether God can--and will, under certain conditions--&nbsp;remove defects of character will be answered with a prompt affirmative by almost any A.A. member.&nbsp;To him, this proposition will be no theory at all; it will be just about the largest fact in his life. He will&nbsp;usually offer his proof in a statement like this:&nbsp;</span></span></div>
						<div>

							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">&quot;Sure, I was beaten, absolutely licked. My own willpower just wouldn&#39;t work on alcohol. Change of&nbsp;scene, the best efforts of family, friends, doctors, and clergymen got no place with my alcoholism. I&nbsp;simply couldn&#39;t stop drinking, and no human being could seem to do the job for me. But when I&nbsp;became willing to clean house and then asked a Higher Power, God as I understood Him, to give me&nbsp;release, my obsession to drink vanished. It was lifted right out of me.&quot;&nbsp;</span></span></div>

						<div>
							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">In A.A. meetings all over the world, statements just like this are heard daily. It is plain for everybody&nbsp;to see that each sober A.A. member has been granted a release from this very obstinate and&nbsp;potentially fatal obsession. So in a very complete and literal way, all A.A.&#39;s have &quot;become entirely&nbsp;ready&quot; to have God remove the mania for alcohol from their lives. And God has proceeded to do&nbsp;exactly that.</span></span></div>
						<div>
							&nbsp;</div>
						<div id="cke_pastebin">
							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Having been granted a perfect release from alcoholism, why then shouldn&#39;t we be able to achieve by&nbsp;the same means a perfect release from every other difficulty or defect? This is a riddle of our&nbsp;existence, the full answer to which may be only in the mind of God. Nevertheless, at least a part of&nbsp;the answer to it is apparent to us.</span></span></div>
						<div>
							&nbsp;</div>
						<div id="cke_pastebin">
							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">When men and women pour so much alcohol into themselves that they destroy their lives, they&nbsp;commit a most unnatural act. Defying their instinctive desire for self-preservation, they seem bent&nbsp;upon self-destruction. They work against their own deepest instinct. As they are humbled by the&nbsp;terrific beating administered by alcohol, the grace of God can enter them and expel their obsession.&nbsp;Here their powerful instinct to live can cooperate fully with their Creator&#39;s desire to give them new&nbsp;life. For nature and God alike abhor suicide.</span></span></div>
						<div>
							&nbsp;</div>
						<div id="cke_pastebin">
							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">But most of our other difficulties don&#39;t fall under such a category at all. Every normal person wants,&nbsp;for example, to eat, to reproduce, to be somebody in the society of his fellows. And he wishes to be&nbsp;reasonably safe and secure as he tries to attain these things. Indeed, God made him that way. He did&nbsp;not design man to destroy himself by alcohol, but He did give man instincts to help him to stay alive.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

						<div>
							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">It is nowhere evident, at least in this life, that our Creator expects us fully to eliminate our instinctual&nbsp;drives. So far as we know, it is nowhere on the record that God has completely removed from any&nbsp;human being all his natural drives.</span></span></div>
						<div>
							&nbsp;</div>
						<div id="cke_pastebin">
							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Since most of us are born with an abundance of natural desires, it isn&#39;t strange that we often let these&nbsp;far exceed their intended purpose. When they drive us blindly, or we willfully demand that theysupply us with more satisfactions or pleasures than are possible or due us, that is the point at which&nbsp;we depart from the degree of perfection that God wishes for us here on earth. That is the measure of&nbsp;our character defects, or, if you wish, of our sins.&nbsp;If we ask, God will certainly forgive our derelictions. But in no case does He render us white as snow&nbsp;and keep us that way without our cooperation. That is something we are supposed to be willing to&nbsp;work toward ourselves. He asks only that we try as best we know how to make progress in the&nbsp;building of character.</span></span></div>

						<div id="cke_pastebin">
							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">So Step Six--&quot;Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character&quot;--is A.A.&#39;s way&nbsp;of stating the best possible attitude one can take in order to make a beginning on this lifetime job.&nbsp;This does not mean that we expect all our character defects to be lifted out of us as the drive to drink&nbsp;was. A few of them may be, but with most of them we shall have to be content with patient&nbsp;improvement. The key words &quot;entirely ready&quot; underline the fact that we want to aim at the very&nbsp;best we know or can learn.</span></span></div>
						<div>
							&nbsp;</div>
						<div id="cke_pastebin">
							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">How many of us have this degree of readiness? In an absolute sense practically nobody has it. The&nbsp;best we can </span></span></div>

Even then the best of us&nbsp;will discover to our dismay that there is always a sticking point, a point at which we say, &quot;No, I can&#39;t&nbsp;give this up yet.&quot; And we shall often tread on even more dangerous ground when we cry, &quot;This I will&nbsp;never give up!&quot; Such is the power of our instincts to overreach themselves. No matter how far we&nbsp;have progressed, desires will always be found which oppose the grace of God.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

						<div>
							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Some who feel they have done well may dispute this, so let&#39;s try to think it through a little further.&nbsp;Practically everybody wishes to be rid of his most glaring and destructive handicaps. No one wants to&nbsp;be so proud that he is scorned as a braggart, nor so greedy that he is labeled a thief. No one wants to&nbsp;be angry enough to murder, lustful enough to rape, gluttonous enough to ruin his health. No one&nbsp;wants to be agonized by the chronic pain of envy or to be paralyzed by sloth. Of course, most human&nbsp;beings don&#39;t suffer these defects at these rock-bottom levels.</span></span></div>
						<div>
							&nbsp;</div>
						<div id="cke_pastebin">
							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">We who have escaped these extremes are apt to congratulate ourselves. Yet can we? After all, hasn&#39;t&nbsp;it been self-interest, pure and simple, that has enabled most of us to escape? Not much spiritual&nbsp;effort is involved in avoiding excesses which will bring us punishment anyway. But when we face up&nbsp;to the less violent aspects of these very same defects, then where do we stand?</span></span></div>
						<div>
							&nbsp;</div>
						<div id="cke_pastebin">
							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">What we must recognize now is that we exult in some of our defect. We really love them. Who, for&nbsp;example, doesn&#39;t like to feel just a little superior to the next fellow, or even quite a lot superior? Isn&#39;t&nbsp;it true that we like to let greed masquerade as ambition? To think of <em>liking</em> lust seems im-</span></span></div>

							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">possible. But&nbsp;how many men and women speak love with their lips, and believe what they say, so that they can&nbsp;hide lust in a dark corner of their minds? And even while staying within conventional bounds, many&nbsp;people have to admit that their imaginary sex excursions are apt to be all dressed up as dreams of&nbsp;romance.</span></span></div>
						<div>
							&nbsp;</div>
						<div id="cke_pastebin">
							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Self-righteous anger also can be very enjoyable. In a perverse way we can actually take satisfaction&nbsp;from the fact that many people annoy us, for it brings a comfortable feeling of superiority. Gossip&nbsp;barbed with our anger, a polite form of murder by character assassination, has its satisfactions for us,&nbsp;too. Here we are not trying to help those we criticize; we are trying to proclaim our own&nbsp;righteousness.</span></span></div>
						<div>
							&nbsp;</div>
						<div id="cke_pastebin">
							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">When gluttony is less than ruinous, we have a milder word for that, too; we call it &quot;taking our&nbsp;comfort.&quot; We live in a world riddled with envy. To a greater or less degree, everybody is infected with&nbsp;it. From this defect we must surely get a warped yet definite satisfaction. Else why would we&nbsp;consume such great amounts of time wishing for what we have not, rather than working for it, or&nbsp;angrily looking for attributes we shall never have, instead of adjusting to the fact, and accepting it?&nbsp;And how often we work hard with no better motive than to be secure and slothful later on--only we&nbsp;call that &quot;retiring.&quot; Consider, too, our talents for procrastination, which is really sloth in five syllables.&nbsp;Nearly anyone could submit a good list of such defects as these, and few of us would seriously think ofgiving them up, at least until they cause us excessive misery.</span></span></div>

							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">deed ready to have all such defects taken from&nbsp;them. But even these people, if they construct a list of still milder defects, will be obliged to admit that&nbsp;they prefer to hang on to some of them. Therefore, it seems plain that few of us can quickly or easily&nbsp;become ready to aim at spiritual and moral perfection; we want to settle for only as much perfection&nbsp;as will get us by in life, according, of course, to our various and sundry ideas of what will get us by. So&nbsp;the difference between &quot;the boys and the men&quot; is the difference between striving for a selfdetermined objective and for the perfect objective which is of God.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

						<div>
							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Many will at once ask, &quot;How can we accept the entire implication of Step Six? Why--that is&nbsp;perfection!&quot; This sounds like a hard question, but practically speaking, it isn&#39;t. Only Step One, where&nbsp;we made the 100 percent admission we were powerless over alcohol, can be practiced with absolute&nbsp;perfection. The remaining eleven Steps state perfect ideals. They are goals toward which we look, and&nbsp;the measuring sticks by which we estimate our progress. Seen in this light, Step Six is still difficult,&nbsp;but not at all impossible. The only urgent thing is that we make a beginning, and keep trying.</span></span></div>
						<div>
							&nbsp;</div>
						<div id="cke_pastebin">
							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">If we would gain any real advantage in the use of this Step on problems other than alcohol, we shall&nbsp;need to make a brand new venture into open-mindedness. We shall need to raise our eyes toward&nbsp;perfection, and be ready to walk in that direction. It will seldom matter how haltingly we walk. The&nbsp;only question will be &quot;Are we ready?&quot;</span></span></div>

							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">have drawn. Perhaps we shall be obliged in some cases still to say, &quot;This I cannot give&nbsp;up yet . . . ,&quot; but we should not say to ourselves, &quot;This I will never give up!&quot;&nbsp;</span></span></div>
						<div>
							&nbsp;</div>
						<div>
							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Let&#39;s dispose of what appears to be a hazardous open end we have left. It is suggested that we ought&nbsp;to become entirely willing to aim toward perfection. We note that some delay, however, might be&nbsp;pardoned. That word, in the mind of a rationalizing alcoholic, could certainly be given a long-term&nbsp;meaning. He could say, &quot;How very easy! Sure, I&#39;ll head toward perfection, but I&#39;m certainly not going&nbsp;to hurry any. Maybe I can postpone dealing with some of my problems indefinitely.&quot; Of course, this&nbsp;won&#39;t do. Such a bluffing oneself will have to go the way of many another pleasant rationalization. At&nbsp;the very least, we shall have to come to grips with some of our worst character defects and take&nbsp;action toward their removal as quickly as we can.</span></span></div>

						<div id="cke_pastebin">
							<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">The moment we say, &quot;No, never!&quot; our minds close against the grace of God. Delay is dangerous, and&nbsp;rebellion may be fatal. This is the exact point at which we abandon limited objectives, and move&nbsp;toward God&#39;s will for us.</span></span></div>
