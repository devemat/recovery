					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">SELF-SUPPORTING alcoholics? Who ever heard of such a thing? Yet we find that&#39;s what we have to&nbsp;be. This principle is telling evidence of the profound change that A.A. has wrought in all of us.&nbsp;Everybody knows that active alcoholics scream that they have no troubles money can&#39;t cure. Always,&nbsp;we&#39;ve had our hands out. Time out of mind we&#39;ve been dependent upon somebody, usually moneywise. When a society composed entirely of alcoholics says it&#39;s going to pay its bills, that&#39;s really news.</span></span></div>
				<div>
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Probably no A.A. Tradition had the labor pains this one did. In early times, we were all broke. When&nbsp;you add to this the habitual supposition that people ought to give money to alcoholics trying to stay&nbsp;sober, it can be understood why we thought we deserved a pile of folding money. What great things&nbsp;A.A. would be able to do with it! But oddly enough, people who had money thought otherwise. They&nbsp;figured that it was high time we now--sober--paid our own way. So our Fellowship stayed poor&nbsp;because it had to.</span></span></div>

				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">There was another reason for our collective poverty. It was soon apparent that while alcoholics would&nbsp;spend lavishly on Twelfth Step cases, they had a terrific aversion to dropping money into a meeting-place hat for group pur-</span></span></div>

We were astounded to find that we were as tight as the bark on a tree.&nbsp;So A.A., the movement, started and stayed broke, while its individual members waxed prosperous.</span></span></div>

					&nbsp;</div>
				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Alcoholics are certainly all-or-nothing people. Our reactions to money prove this. As A.A. emerged&nbsp;from its infancy into adolescence, we swung from the idea that we needed vast sums of money to the&nbsp;notion that A.A. shouldn&#39;t have any. On every lip were the words &quot;You can&#39;t mix A.A. and money. We&nbsp;shall have to separate the spiritual from the material.&quot; We took this violent new tack because here&nbsp;and there members had tried to make money out of their A.A. connections, and we feared we&#39;d be&nbsp;exploited. Now and then, grateful benefactors ahd endowed clubhouses, as as a result there was&nbsp;sometimes outside interference in our affairs. We had been presented with a hospital, and almost&nbsp;immediately the donor&#39;s son became its principal patient and would-be manager. One A.A. group was&nbsp;given five thousand dollars to do with what it would. The hassle over that chunk of money played&nbsp;havoc for years. Frightened by these complications, some groups refused to have a cent in their&nbsp;treasuries.</span></span></div>

					&nbsp;</div>
				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Despite these misgivings, we had to recognize the fact that A.A. had to function. Meeting places cost&nbsp;something. To save whole areas from turmoil, small offices had to be set up, telephones installed, and&nbsp;a few full-time secretaries hired. Over many protests, these things were accomplished. We saw that if&nbsp;they weren&#39;t, the man coming in the door couldn&#39;t get a break. These simple services would require&nbsp;</span></span></div>

				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">In this connection, Bill likes to tell the following pointed story. He explains that when Jack Alexander&#39;s&nbsp;Saturday Evening Post piece broke in 1941, thousands of frantic letters from distraught alcoholics and&nbsp;their families hit the Foundation* letterbox in New York. &quot;Our office staff,&quot; Bill says, &quot;consisted of two&nbsp;people: one devoted secretary and myself. How could this landslide of appeals be met? We&#39;d have to&nbsp;have some more full-time help, that was sure. So we asked the A.A. groups for voluntary&nbsp;contributions. Would they send us a dollar a member a year? Otherwise this heartbreaking mail&nbsp;would have to go unanswered.</span></span></div>

					&nbsp;</div>
				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">&quot;To my surprise, the response of the groups was slow. I got mighty sore about it. Looking at thisavalanche of mail one morning at the office, I paced up and down ranting how irresponsible and&nbsp;tightwad my fellow members were. Just then an old acquaintance stuck a tousled and aching head in&nbsp;the door. He was our prize slippee. I could see he had an awful hangover. Remembering some of my&nbsp;own, my heart filled with pity. I motioned him to my inside cubicle and produced a five dollar bill. As&nbsp;my total income was thirty dollars a week at the time, this was a fairly large donation. Lois really&nbsp;needed the money for groceries, but that didn&#39;t stop me. The intense relief on my friend&#39;s face&nbsp;warmed my heart. I felt especially virtuous as I thought of all the ex- </span></span></div>

				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">&quot;The meeting that night was at New York&#39;s old 24th Street Clubhouse. During the intermission, the&nbsp;treasurer gave a timid talk on how broke the club was. (That was in the period when you couldn&#39;t mix&nbsp;money and A.A.) But finally he said it--the landlord would put us out if we didn&#39;t pay up. He concluded&nbsp;his remarks by saying, &#39;Now boys, please go heavier on the hat tonight, will you?&#39;</span></span></div>
				<div>
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">&quot;I heard all this quite plainly, as I was piously trying to convert a newcomer who sat next to me. The&nbsp;hat came in my direction, I fumbled and came up with a fifty-cent piece. Somehow it looked like a&nbsp;very big coin. Hastily, I dropped it back and fished out a dime, which clinked thinly as I dropped it in&nbsp;the hat. Hats never got folding money in those days.</span></span></div>

					&nbsp;</div>
				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">&quot;Then I woke up. I who had boasted my generosity that morning was treating my own club worse&nbsp;than the distant alcoholics who had forgotten to send the Foundation their dollars. I realized that my&nbsp;five-dollar gift to the slippee was an ego feeding proposition. bad for him and bad for me. There <em>was</em> a&nbsp;place in A.A. where spirituality and money would mix, and that was in the hat!&quot;</span></span></div>

					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">There is another story about money. One night in 1948, the trustees of the Foundation were having&nbsp;their quarterly meeting. The agenda discussion included a very important question. A certain lady&nbsp;had died. When her will was read, it was discovered she had left Alcoholics Anonymous in </span></span></div>

					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">trust with&nbsp;the Alcoholic Foundation a sum of ten thousand dollars. The question was: Should A.A. take the gift?&nbsp;</span></span></div>
				<div>
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div>
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">What a debate we had on that one! The Foundation was really hard up just then; the groups weren&#39;t&nbsp;sending in enough for the support of the office; we had been tossing in all the book income and even&nbsp;that hadn&#39;t been enough. The reserve was melting like snow in springtime. We needed that ten&nbsp;thousand dollars. &quot;Maybe,&quot; some said, &quot;the groups will never fully support the office. We can&#39;t let it&nbsp;shut down; it&#39;s far too vital. Yes, let&#39;s take the money. Let&#39;s take all such donations in the future.&nbsp;We&#39;re going to need them.&quot;</span></span></div>
				<div>
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Then came the opposition. They pointed out that the Foundation board already knew of a total of half&nbsp;a million dollars set aside for A.A. in the wills of people still alive. Heaven only knew how much there&nbsp;was we hadn&#39;t heard about. If outside donations weren&#39;t declined, absolutely cut off, then the&nbsp;Foundation would one day become rich. Moreover, at the slightest intimation to the general public&nbsp;from our trustees that we needed money, we could become immensely rich. Compared to this&nbsp;prospect, the ten thousand dollars under consideration wasn&#39;t much, but like the alcoholic&#39;s first drink&nbsp;it would, if taken, inevitably set up a disastrous chain reaction. Where would that land us? Whoever&nbsp;pays the piper is apt to call the tune, and if the A.A. Foundation obtained money from outside sources,&nbsp;its trustees might be tempted to run things without reference to the wishes of A.A. as a whole.&nbsp;Relieved of responsibility, every alcoholic would shrug and say, &quot;Oh, the Foundation is wealthy--why&nbsp;should I bother? The pressure of that fat treasury would surely tempt the board to invent all kinds of&nbsp;</span></span></div>

					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">schemes to do good with such funds, and so divert A.A. from its primary purpose. The moment that&nbsp;happened, our Fellowship&#39;s confidence would be shaken. The board would be isolated, and would fall&nbsp;under heavy attack of criticism from both A.A. and the public. These were the possibilities, pro and&nbsp;con.</span></span></div>
				<div>
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Then our trustees wrote a bright page of A.A. history. They declared for the principle that A.A. must&nbsp;always stay poor. Bare running expenses plus a prudent reserve would henceforth be the&nbsp;Foundation&#39;s financial policy. Difficult as it was, they officially declined that ten thousand dollars, and&nbsp;adopted a formal, airtight resolution that all such future gifts would be similarly declined. At thatmoment, we believe, the principle of corporate poverty was firmly and finally embedded in A.A.&nbsp;tradition.</span></span></div>

					&nbsp;</div>
				<div id="cke_pastebin">
					<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">When these facts were printed, there was a profound reaction. To people familiar with endless drives&nbsp;for charitable funds, A.A. presented a strange and refreshing spectacle. Approving editorials here and&nbsp;abroad generated a wave of confidence in the integrity of Alcoholics Anonymous. They pointed out&nbsp;that the irresponsible had become responsible, and that by making financial independence part of its&nbsp;tradition, Alcoholics Anonymous had revived an ideal that its era had almost forgotten.</span></span></div>
