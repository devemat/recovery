								<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">NEVER since it began has Alcoholics Anonymous been divided by a major controversial issue. Nor has&nbsp;our Fellowship ever publicly taken sides on any question in an embattled world. This, however, has&nbsp;been no earned virtue. It could almost be said that we were born with it, for, as one oldtimer recently&nbsp;declared, &quot;Practically never have I heard a heated religious, political, or reform argument among A.A.&nbsp;members. So long as we don&#39;t argue these matters privately, it&#39;s a cinch we never shall publicly.&quot;</span></span></div>

								<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">As by some deep instinct, we A.A.&#39;s have known from the very beginning that we must never, no&nbsp;matter what the provocation, publicly take sides in any fight, even a worthy one. All history affords us&nbsp;the spectacle of striving nations and groups finally torn asunder because they were designed for, or&nbsp;tempted into, controversy. Others fell apart because of sheer self-righteousness while trying to&nbsp;enforce upon the rest of mankind some millennium of their own specification. In our own times, we&nbsp;have seen millions die in political and economic wars often spurred by religious and racial difference.&nbsp;We live in the imminent possibility of a fresh holocaust to determine how men shall be governed, and&nbsp;how the products of nature and toil shall be divided among </span></span></div>

								<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Let us reemphasize that this reluctance to fight one another or anybody else is not counted as some&nbsp;special virtue which makes us feel superior to other people. Nor does it mean that the members of&nbsp;Alcoholics Anonymous, now restored as citizens of the world, are going to back away from their&nbsp;individual responsibilities to act as they see the right upon issues of our time. But when it comes to&nbsp;A.A. as a whole, that&#39;s quite a different matter. In this respect, we do not enter into public&nbsp;controversy, because we know that our Society will perish if it does. We conceive the survival and&nbsp;spread of Alcoholics Anonymous to be something of far greater importance than the weight we could&nbsp;collectively throw back of any other cause. Since recovery from alcoholism is life itself to us, it is&nbsp;imperative that we preserve in full strength our means of survival.</span></span></div>

								<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Maybe this sounds as though the alcoholics in A.A. had suddenly gone peaceable, and become one&nbsp;great big happy family. Of course, this isn&#39;t so at all. Human beings that we are, we squabble. Before&nbsp;we leveled off a bit, A.A. looked more like one prodigious squabble than anything else, at least on the&nbsp;surface. A corporation director who had just voted a company expenditure of a hundred thousand&nbsp;dollars would appear at an A.A. business meeting and blow his top over an outlay of twenty-five&nbsp;dollars&#39; worth of needed postage stamps. Disliking the attempt of some to manage a group, half its&nbsp;membership might angrily rush off to form another group more to their liking. Elders, temporarily&nbsp;turned Pharisee, have sulked. Bitter attacks </span></span></div>

Despite their din, our puny rows never did A.A. a particle of harm. They were just part and&nbsp;parcel of learning to work and live together. Let it be noted, too, that they were almost always&nbsp;concerned with ways to make A.A. more effective, how to do the most good for the most alcoholics.</span></span></div>

								<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">The Washingtonian Society, a movement among alcoholics which started in Baltimore a century ago,&nbsp;almost discovered the answer to alcoholism. At first, the society was composed entirely of alcoholics&nbsp;trying to help one another. The early members foresaw that they should dedicate themselves to this&nbsp;sole aim. In many respects, the Washingtonians were akin to A.A. of today. Their membership passed&nbsp;the hundred thousand mark. Had they been left to themselves, and had they stuck to their one goal,&nbsp;they might have found the rest of the answer. But this didn&#39;t happen. Instead, the Washingtonianspermitted politicians and reformers, both alcoholic and nonalcoholic, to use the society for their own&nbsp;purposes. Abolition of slavery, for example, was a stormy political issue then. Soon, Washingtonian&nbsp;speakers violently and publicly took sides on this question. Maybe the society could have survived the&nbsp;abolition controversy, but it didn&#39;t have a chance from the moment it determined to reform America&#39;s&nbsp;drinking habits. When the Washingtonians became temperance crusaders, within a very few years&nbsp;they had completely lost their effectiveness in helping alcoholics.</span></span></div>
