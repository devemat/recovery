															<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">WHERE does A.A. get its direction? Who runs it? This too, is a puzzler for every friend and newcomer.&nbsp;When told that our society has no president having authority to govern it, no treasurer who can&nbsp;compel the payment of any dues, no board of directors who can cast an erring member into outer&nbsp;darkness, when indeed no A.A. can give another a directive and enforce obedience, our friends gasp&nbsp;and exclaim, &quot;This simply can&#39;t be. There must be an angle somewhere.&quot; These practical folk then&nbsp;read Tradition Two, and learn that the sole authority in A.A. is a loving God as he may express&nbsp;Himself in the group conscience. They dubiously ask an experienced A.A. member if this really works.&nbsp;The member, sane to all appearences, immediately answers, &quot;Yes! It definitely does.&quot; The friends&nbsp;mutter that this looks vague, nebulous, pretty naive to them. Then they commence to watch us with&nbsp;speculative eyes, pick up a fragment of A.A. history, and soon have the solid facts. What are these&nbsp;facts of A.A. life which brought us to this apparently impractical principle? John Doe, a good A.A.,&nbsp;moves -- let us say -- to Middletown, U.S.A.</span></span></div>

He feels a spiritual and ethical compulsion, because hundreds may be suffering within&nbsp;reach of his help. Then, too, he misses his home group. He needs other alcoholics as much as they&nbsp;need him. He visits preachers, doctors, editors, policemen, and bartenders . . . with the result that&nbsp;Mlddletown now has a group, and he is the founder.</span></span></div>

Very soon, though, his assumed authority&nbsp;to run everything begins to be shared with the first alcoholics he has helped. At this moment, the&nbsp;benign dictator becomes the chairman of a committee composed of his friends. These are the growing&nbsp;group&#39;s hierarchy of service --self-appointed, of course, because there is no other way. In a matter of&nbsp;months, A.A. booms in Middletown.</span></span></div>

Being on the human side, the founder&nbsp;and his friends may bask a little in glory. They say to one another, &quot;Perhaps it would be a good idea if&nbsp;we continue to keep a firm hand on A.A. in this town. After all, we are experienced. Besides, look at all&nbsp;the good we&#39;ve done these drunks. They should be grateful!&quot; True, founders and their friends are&nbsp;sometimes wiser and more humble than this. But more often at this stage they are not.</span></span></div>

Let&#39;s have an election!&quot; The founder&nbsp;and his friends are hurt and depressed. They rush from crisis to crises and from member to member,&nbsp;pleading; but it&#39;s no use, the revolution is on. The group conscience is about to take over.</span></span></div>
														<div>
															&nbsp;</div>
														<div id="cke_pastebin">
															<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Now comes the election. lf the founder and his fiends have served well, they may --to their surprise --&nbsp;be reinstated for a time. lf, however, they have heavily resisted the rising tide of democracy, they&nbsp;may be summarily beached. In either case, the group now has a so-called rotating committee, verysharply limited in its authority. In no sense whatever can its members govern or direct the group.&nbsp;They are servants. Theirs is the sometimes thankless privilege of doing the group&#39;s chores. Headed by&nbsp;the chairman, they look after public relations and arrange meetings. Their treasurer, strictly&nbsp;accountable, takes money from the hat that is passed, banks it, pays the rent and other bills, and</span></span></div>
														<div id="cke_pastebin">
															<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">makes a regular report at business meetings. The secretary sees that literature is on the table, looks&nbsp;after the phone-answering service, answers the mail, and sends out notices of meetings. Such are the&nbsp;simple services that enable the group to function. The committee gives no spiritual advice, judges no&nbsp;one&#39;s conduct, issues no orders. Every one of them may be promptly eliminated at the next election if&nbsp;they try this. And so they make the belated discovery that they are really servants, not senators.&nbsp;These are universal experiences. Thus throughout A.A. does the group conscience decree the terms&nbsp;upon which its leaders shall serve.</span></span></div>

														<div id="cke_pastebin">
															<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">This brings us straight to the question does A A. have a real leadership?&quot; Most emphatically the&nbsp;answer is &quot;Yes, </span></span></div>

															<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">notwithstanding the apparent lack of it.&quot; Let&#39;s turn again to the deposed founder and&nbsp;his friends. What becomes of them? As their grief and anxiety wear away, a subtle change begins.&nbsp;Ultimately, they devide into two classes known in A A. slang as &quot;elder statesmen&quot; and &quot;bleeding&nbsp;deacons.&quot; The elder statesman is the one who sees the wisdom of the group&#39;s decision, who holds no&nbsp;resentment over his reduced status, whose judgment, fortified by considerable experience, is sound,&nbsp;and who is willing to sit quietly on the sidelines patiently awaiting developments. The bleeding deacon&nbsp;is one who is just as surely convinced that the group cannot get along without him, who constantly&nbsp;connives for reelectlon to office, and who continues to be consumed with self pity. A few hemorrhage&nbsp;so badly that -- drained of all A.A. spirit and principle -- they get drunk. At times the A.A. landscape&nbsp;seems to be littered with bleeding forms. Nearly every oldtimer in our Society has gone through this&nbsp;process in some degree. Happily, most of them survive and live to become elder statesmen. They&nbsp;become the real and permanent leadership of A.A. Theirs is the quiet opinion, the sure knowledge and&nbsp;humble example that resolve a crisis. When sorely perplexed, the group inevitably turns to them for&nbsp;advice. They become the voice of the group conscience; in fact, these are the true voice of Alcoholics&nbsp;Anonymous. They do not drive by mandate; they lead by example. This is the experience which has&nbsp;led us to the conclusion that our group conscience, well-advised by its elders, will be in the long run&nbsp;wiser than any single leader.</span></span></div>

														<div id="cke_pastebin">
															<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">&quot;One day I was doing a Twelfth Step job at a hospital in New York The proprietor, Charlie, summoned&nbsp;me to his office. &#39;Bill,&#39; he said, &#39;I think it&#39;s a shame that you are financially so hard up. All around you&nbsp;these drunks are getting well and making money. But you&#39;re giving this work full time, and you&#39;re&nbsp;broke. It isn&#39;t fair.&#39; Charlie fished in his desk and came up with an old financial statement. Handing it&nbsp;to me, he continued, &#39;This shows the kind of money the hospital used to make back in the 1920&#39;s.&nbsp;Thousands of dollars a month. It should be doing just as well now, and it would --if only you&#39;d help me.&nbsp;So why don&#39;t you move your work in here? I&#39;ll give you an office, a decent drawing account, and a&nbsp;very healthy slice of the profits. Three years ago, when my head doctor, Silkworth, began to tell me of&nbsp;the idea of helping drunks by spirituality, I thought it was crackpot stuff, but l&#39;ve changed my mind.&nbsp;Some day this bunch of ex-drunks of yours will fill Madison Square Garden, and I don&#39;t see why you&nbsp;should starve meanwhile. What I propose is perfectly ethical. You can become a lay therapist, and&nbsp;more successful than anybody in the business.&#39;</span></span></div>
														<div>
															&nbsp;</div>
														<div id="cke_pastebin">
															<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">&quot;I was bowled over. There were a few twinges of conscience until I saw how really ethical Charlie&#39;s&nbsp;proposal was. There was nothing wrong whatever with becoming a lay therapist. I thought of Lois&nbsp;coming home exhausted from the department store each day, only to cook supper for a houseful of&nbsp;drunks who weren&#39;t paying board. I thought of the large sum of money still owing my Wall Street&nbsp;creditors. I thought of a few of my alcoholic friends, who were making </span></span></div>

															&nbsp;</div>
														<div id="cke_pastebin">
															<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">&quot;Although I asked Charlie for a little time to consider it, my own mind was about made up. Racing&nbsp;back to Brooklyn on the subway, I had a seeming flash of divine guidance. It was only a single sentence, but most convincing. In fact, it came right out of the Bible -- a voice kept saying to me, &#39;The&nbsp;laborer is worthy of his hire.&#39; Arriving home, I found Lois cooking as usual, while three drunks looked&nbsp;hungrily on from the kitchen door. I drew her aside and told the glorious news. She looked interested:&nbsp;but not as excited as I thought she should be.</span></span></div>

															&nbsp;</div>
														<div id="cke_pastebin">
															<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">&quot;It was meeting night. Although none of the alcoholics we boarded seemed to get sober, some others&nbsp;had. With their wives they crowded into our downstairs parlor. At once I burst into the story of my&nbsp;opportunity. Never shall I forget their impassive faces, and the steady gaze they focused upon me.&nbsp;With waning enthusiasm, my tale trailed of to the end. There was a long silence.</span></span></div>

														<div id="cke_pastebin">
															<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">&quot;Almost timidly, one of my friends began to speak. &#39;We know how hard up you are, Bill. It bothers us a&nbsp;lot. We&#39;ve often wondered what we might do about it. But I think I speak for everyone here when I&nbsp;say that what you now propose bothers us an awful lot more.&#39; The speaker&#39;s voice grew more&nbsp;confident. &#39;Don&#39;t you realize,&#39; he went on, &#39;that you can never become a professional? As generous as&nbsp;Charlie has been to us, don&#39;t you see that we can&#39;t tie this thing up with his hospital or any other? You&nbsp;tell us that Charlie&#39;s proposal is ethical. Sure, it&#39;s ethical, but what we&#39;ve got won&#39;t run on ethics only;&nbsp;it has to be better. Sure, Charlie&#39;s idea is good, but it isn&#39;t good enough.

Well, this is a plain case of it. You can&#39;t do this thing to us!&#39;</span></span></div>
