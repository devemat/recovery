But when we&nbsp;approach Step Ten we commence to put our A.A. way of living to practical use, day by day, in fair&nbsp;weather or foul. Then comes the acid test: can we stay sober, keep in emotional balance, and live to&nbsp;good purpose under all conditions?</span></span></div>

											<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">A continuous look at our assets and liabilities, and a real desire to learn and grow by this means, are&nbsp;necessities for us. We alcoholics have learned this the hard way. More experienced people, of course,&nbsp;in all times and places have practiced unsparing self-survey and criticism. For the wise have always&nbsp;known that no one can make much of his life until self-searching becomes a regular habit, until he is&nbsp;able to admit and accept what he finds, and until he patiently and persistently tries to correct what is&nbsp;wrong.</span></span></div>

That is&nbsp;the emotional hangover, the direct result of yesterday&#39;s and sometimes today&#39;s excesses of negative&nbsp;emotion-anger, fear, jealousy, and the like. If we would live serenely today and tomorrow, we&nbsp;certainly need to eliminate these hangovers. This doesn&#39;t mean we</span></span></div>

It requires an admission and correction of errors now. Our inventory enables us to settle&nbsp;with the past. When this is done, we are really able to leave it behind us. When our inventory is&nbsp;carefully taken, and we have made peace with ourselves, the conviction follows that tomorrow&#39;s&nbsp;challenges can be met as they come.</span></span></div>

											<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Although all inventories are alike in principle, the time factor does distinguish one from another.&nbsp;There&#39;s the spotcheck inventory, taken at any time of the day, whenever we find ourselves getting&nbsp;tangled up. There&#39;s the one we take at day&#39;s end, when we review the happenings of the hours just&nbsp;past. Here we cast up a balance sheet, crediting ourselves with things well done, and chalking up&nbsp;debits where due. Then there are those occasions when alone, or in the company of our sponsor or&nbsp;spiritual adviser, we make a careful review of our progress since the last time. Many A.A.&#39;s go in for&nbsp;annual or semiannual housecleanings. Many of us also like the experience of an occasional retreat&nbsp;from the outside world where we can quiet down for an undisturbed day or so of self-overhaul and&nbsp;meditation.</span></span></div>

Must A.A.&#39;s spend most of their waking&nbsp;hours drearily rehashing their sins of omission or commission? Well, hardly. The emphasis on&nbsp;inventory is heavy only because a great many of us have never really acquired the habit of accurate&nbsp;self-appraisal. Once this healthy practice has become grooved, it will be so interesting and profitable&nbsp;that the time it takes won&#39;t be missed.

											<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Before we ask what a spot-check inventory is, let&#39;s look at the kind of setting in which such an&nbsp;inventory can do its work.</span></span></div>

											&nbsp;</div>
										<div id="cke_pastebin">
											<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">It is a spiritual axiom that every time we are disturbed, no matter what the cause, there is something&nbsp;wrong with us. If somebody hurts us and we are sore, we are in the wrong also. But are there noexceptions to this rule? What about &quot;justifiable&quot; anger? If somebody cheats us, aren&#39;t we entitled to&nbsp;be mad? Can&#39;t we be properly angry with self-righteous folk? For us of A.A. these are dangerous&nbsp;exceptions. We have found that justified anger ought to be left to those better qualified to handle it.</span></span></div>

										<div id="cke_pastebin">
											<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Few people have been more victimized by resentments than have we alcoholics. It mattered little&nbsp;whether our resentments were justified or not. A burst of temper could spoil a day, and a well-nursed&nbsp;grudge could make us miserably ineffective. Nor were we ever skillful in separating justified from&nbsp;unjustified anger. As we saw it, our wrath was always justified. Anger, that occasional luxury of more&nbsp;balanced people, could keep us on an emotional jag indefinitely. These emotional &quot;dry benders&quot; often&nbsp;led straight to the bottle. Other kinds of disturbances--jealousy, envy, self--pity, or hurt pride-did&nbsp;the same thing.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

											<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">A spot-check inventory taken in the midst of such disturbances can be of very great help in quieting&nbsp;stormy emotions.

The quick inventory is aimed at our daily ups and&nbsp;downs, especially those where people or new events throw us off balance and tempt us to make&nbsp;mistakes.</span></span></div>
										<div>
											&nbsp;</div>
										<div id="cke_pastebin">
											<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">In all these situations we need self-restraint, honest analysis of what is involved, a willingness to&nbsp;admit when the fault is ours, and an equal willingness to forgive when the fault is elsewhere. We need&nbsp;not be discouraged when we fall into the error of our old ways, for these disciplines are not easy. We&nbsp;shall look for progress, not for perfection.</span></span></div>

											&nbsp;</div>
										<div id="cke_pastebin">
											<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Our first objective will be the development of self-restraint. This carries a top priority rating. When&nbsp;we speak or act hastily or rashly, the ability to be fair-minded and tolerant evaporates on the spot.&nbsp;One unkind tirade or one willful snap judgment can ruin our relation with another person for a whole&nbsp;day, or maybe a whole year. Nothing pays off like restraint of tongue and pen. We must avoid quicktempered criticism and furious, power-driven argument. The same goes for sulking or silent scorn.&nbsp;These are emotional booby traps baited with pride and vengefulness. Our first job is to sidestep the&nbsp;traps. When we are tempted by the bait, we should train ourselves to step back and think. For we can&nbsp;neither think nor act to good purpose until the habit of self-restraint has become automatic.</span></span></div>

When temporary good fortune came our way, we&nbsp;indulged ourselves in fantasies of still greater victories over people and circumstances. Thus blinded&nbsp;by prideful self-confidence, we were apt to play the big shot. Of course, people turned away from us,&nbsp;bored or hurt.</span></span></div>

											<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Now that we&#39;re in A.A. and sober, and winning back the esteem of our friends and business associates,&nbsp;we find that we still need to exercise special vigilance. As an insurance against &quot;big-shot-ism&quot; we can&nbsp;often check ourselves by remembering that we are today sober only by the grace of God and that any&nbsp;success we may be having is far more His success than ours.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

											<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Finally, we begin to see that all people, including ourselves, are to some extent emotionally ill as well&nbsp;as frequently wrong, and then we approach true tolerance and see what real love for our fellows&nbsp;actually means. It will become more and more evident as we go forward that it is pointless to become&nbsp;angry, or to get hurt by people who, like us, are suffering from the pains of growing up.</span></span></div>

Not many people can&nbsp;truthfully assert that they love everybody. Most of us must admit that we have loved but a few; that&nbsp;we have been quite indifferent to the many so long as none of them gave us trouble; and as for the&nbsp;remainder--well, we have really disliked or hated them. Although these attitudes are common&nbsp;enough, we A.A.&#39;s find we need something much better in order to keep our balance. We can&#39;t stand it&nbsp;if we hate deeply.

Courtesy, kindness, justice, and love are the keynotes by&nbsp;which we may come into harmony with practically anybody. When in doubt we can always pause,&nbsp;saying, &quot;Not my will, but Thine, be done.&quot; And we can often ask ourselves, &quot;Am I doing to others as I&nbsp;would have them do to me--today?&quot;</span></span></div>

											<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">When evening comes, perhaps just before going to sleep, many of us draw up a balance sheet for the&nbsp;day. This is a good place to remember that inventory-taking is not always done in red ink. It&#39;s a poor&nbsp;day indeed when we haven&#39;t done something right. As a matter of fact, the waking hours are usually&nbsp;well filled with things that are constructive. Good intentions, good thoughts, and good acts are there&nbsp;for us to see. Even when we have tried hard and failed, we may chalk that up as one of the greatest&nbsp;credits of all. Under these conditions, the pains of failure are converted into assets.

											<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">As we glance down the debit side of the day&#39;s ledger, we should carefully examine our motives in each&nbsp;thought or act that appears to be wrong. In most cases our motives won&#39;t be hard to see and&nbsp;understand. When prideful, angry, jealous, anxious, or fearful, we acted accordingly, and that was&nbsp;that. Here we need only recognize that we did act or think badly, try to visualize how we might have&nbsp;done better, and resolve with God&#39;s help to carry these lessons over into tomorrow, making, of&nbsp;course, any amends still neglected.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

We&nbsp;sometimes hurt those we love because they need to be &quot;taught a lesson,&quot; when we really want to&nbsp;punish. We were depressed and complained we felt bad, when in fact we were mainly asking for&nbsp;sympathy and attention.
