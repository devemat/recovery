		<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">AUTONOMY is ten-dollar word. But in relation to us, it means very simply that every A.A. group can&nbsp;manage its affairs exactly as it pleases, except when A.A. as a whole is threatened. Comes now the&nbsp;same question raised in Tradition One. Isn&#39;t such liberty foolishly dangerous?</span></span></div>

		<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Over the years, every conceivable deviation from our Twelve Steps and Traditions has been tried.&nbsp;That was sure to be, since we are so largely a band of ego-driven individualists. Children of chaos, we&nbsp;have defiantly played with every brand of fire, only to emerge unharmed and, we think, wiser. These&nbsp;very deviations created a vast process of trial and error which, under the grace of God, has brought us&nbsp;to where we stand today.</span></span></div>

		<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">When A.A.&#39;s Traditions were first published, in 1946, we had become sure that an A.A. group could&nbsp;stand almost any amount of battering. We saw that the group, exactly like the individual, must&nbsp;eventually conform to whatever tested principles would guarantee survival. We had discovered that&nbsp;there was perfect safety in the process of trial and error. So confident of this had we become that the&nbsp;original statement of A.A. tradition carried this significant sentence: &quot;Any two or three alcoholics&nbsp;gathered together for sobriety </span></span></div>

	<div>
		&nbsp;</div>
	<div id="cke_pastebin">
		<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">This meant, of course, that we had been given the courage to declare each A.A. group an individual&nbsp;entity, strictly reliant on its own conscience as a guide to action. In charting this enormous expanse of&nbsp;freedom, we found it necessary to post only two storm signals: A group ought not do anything which&nbsp;would greatly injure A.A. as a whole, nor ought it affiliate itself with anything or anybody else. There&nbsp;would be real danger should we commence to call some groups &quot;wet,&quot; others &quot;dry,&quot; still others&nbsp;&quot;Republican&quot; or &quot;Communist,&quot; and yet others &quot;Catholic&quot; or &quot;Protestant.&quot; The A.A. group would have&nbsp;to stick to its course or be hopelessly lost. Sobriety had to be its sole objective. In all other respects,&nbsp;there was perfect freedom of will and action. Every group had the right to be wrong.</span></span></div>

		<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">When A.A. was still young, lots of eager groups were forming. In a town we&#39;ll call Middleton, a real&nbsp;crackerjack had started up. The townspeople were as hot as firecrackers about it. Stargazing, the&nbsp;elders dreamed of innovations. They figured the town needed a great big alcoholic center, a kind of&nbsp;pilot plant A.A. groups could duplicate everywhere. Beginning on the ground floor there would be a&nbsp;club; in the second story they would sober up drunks and hand them currency for their back debts;&nbsp;the third deck would house an educational project-quite noncontroversial, of course. In imagination&nbsp;the gleaming center was to go up several stories more, but three would do for a start. This would all&nbsp;take a lot of money-other people&#39;s money. Believe it or not, wealthy townsfolk bought the idea.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

		<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">There were, though, a few conservative dissenters among the alcoholics. They wrote the Foundation,&nbsp;A.A.&#39;s headquarters in New York, wanting to know about this sort of streamlining. They understood&nbsp;that the elders, just to nail things down good, were about to apply to the Foundation for a charter.&nbsp;These few were disturbed and skeptical.</span></span></div>

	<div id="cke_pastebin">
		<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">Of course, there was a promoter in the deal--a superpromotor. By his eloquence he allayed all fears,&nbsp;despite advice from the Foundation that it could issue no charter, and that ventures which mixed an&nbsp;A.A. group with medication and education had come to sticky ends elsewhere. To make things safer,&nbsp;the promoter organized three corporations and became president of them all. Freshly painted, the&nbsp;new center shone. The warmth of it all spread through the town. Soon things began to hum. To insure foolproof, continuous operation, sixty-one rules and regulations were adopted.</span></span></div>

	<div id="cke_pastebin">
		<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">But alas, this bright scene was not long in darkening. Confusion replaced serenity. It was found that&nbsp;some drunks yearned for education, but doubted if they were alcoholics. The personality defects of&nbsp;others could be cured maybe with a loan. Some were club-minded, but it was just a question of taking&nbsp;care of the lonely heart. Sometimes the swarming applicants would go for all three floors. Some would&nbsp;start at the top and come through to the bottom, becoming club members; others started in the club,&nbsp;pitched a binge, were hospitalized, then graduated to education on the third floor.</span></span></div>

An A.A. group, as&nbsp;such, simply couldn&#39;t handle this sort of project. All too late that was discovered.

A chill&nbsp;chokedamp of fear and frustration fell over the group.</span></span></div>

	<div id="cke_pastebin">
		<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; ">When that lifted, a wonderful thing happened. The head promoter wrote the Foundation office. He&nbsp;said he wished he&#39;d paid some attention to A.A. experience. Then he did something else that was to&nbsp;become an A.A. classic. It all went on a little card about golf-score size. The cover read: &quot;Middleton&nbsp;Group #1. Rule #62.&quot; Once the card was unfolded, a single pungent sentence leaped to the eye: &quot;Don&#39;t&nbsp;take yourself too damn seriously.&quot;</span></span></div>

Moreover, it&nbsp;had performed a great service for Alcoholics Anonymous, because it had been humbly willing to apply&nbsp;the lessons it learned. It had picked itself up with a laugh and gone on to better things. Even the chief&nbsp;architect, standing in the ruins of his dream, could laugh at himself-and that is the very acme of&nbsp;humility.</span></span></div>
