	<span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path. Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program, usually men and women who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves. There are such unfortunates. They are not at fault; they seem to have been born that way. They are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a manner of living which demands rigorous honesty. Their chances are less than average.</span></span></p>

	<span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The first requirement is that we be convinced that any life run on self-will can hardly be a success. On that basis we are almost always in collision with something or somebody, even though our motives are good. Most people try to live by self-propulsion. Each person is like an actor who wants to run the whole show; is forever trying to arrange the lights, the ballet, the scenery and the rest of the players in his own way. If </span></span></p>

Everybody, including himself, would be pleased. Life would be wonderful. In trying to make these arrangements our actor may sometimes be quite virtuous. He may be kind, considerate, patient, generous; even modest and self-sacrificing. On the other hand, he may be mean, egotistical, selfish and dishonest. But, as with most humans, he is more likely to have varied traits.</span></span></p>

	<span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;What usually happens? The show doesn&#39;t come off very well. He begins to think life doesn&#39;t treat him right. He decides to exert himself more. He becomes, on the next occasion, still more demanding or gracious, as the case may be. Still the play does not suit him. Admitting he may be somewhat at fault, he is sure that other people are more to blame. He becomes angry, indignant, self-pitying. What is his basic trouble? Is he not really a self-seeker even when trying to be kind? Is he not a victim of the delusion that he can wrest satisfaction and happiness out of this world if he only manages well? Is it not evident to all the rest of the players that these are the things he wants? And do not his actions make each of them wish to retaliate, snatching all they can get out of the show? Is he not, even in his best moments, a producer of confusion rather than harmony?</span></span></p>

	<span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Our actor is self-centered, ego-centric, as people like to call it nowadays. He is like the retired business man who lolls in the Florida sunshine in the winter complaining of the sad state of the nation; the minister who sighs over the sins of the twentieth century; politicians and reformers who are sure all would be Utopia </span></span></p>

	<span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Selfishness, self-centeredness! That, we think, is the root of our troubles. Driven by a hundred forms of fear, self-delusion, self-seeking, and self-pity, we step on the toes of our fellows and they retaliate. Sometimes they hurt us, seemingly without provocation, but we invariably find that at some time in the past we have made decisions based on self which later placed us in a position to be hurt.</span></span></p>

	<span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;So our troubles, we think, are basically of our own making. They arise out of ourselves, and the alcoholic is an extreme example of self-will run riot, though he usually doesn&#39;t think so. Above everything, we alcoholics must be rid of this selfishness. We must, or it kill us! God makes that possible. And there often seems no way of entirely getting rid of self without His aid. Many of us had moral and philosophical convictions galore, but we could not live up to them even though we would have liked to. Neither could we reduce our self-centeredness much by wishing or trying on our own power. We had to have God&#39;s help.</span></span></p>

	<span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;This is the how and the why of it. First of all, we had to quit playing God. It didn&#39;t work. Next, we decided that hereafter in this drama of life, God was going to be our Director. He is the Principal; we are His agents. He is the Father, and we are His children. Most Good ideas are simple, and this concept was the keystone of the new and triumphant arch through which we passed to freedom.</span></span></p>

We had a new Employer. Being all powerful, He provided what we needed, if we kept close to Him and performed His work well. Established on such a footing we became less and less interested in ourselves, our own little plans and designs. More and more we became interested in seeing what we could contribute to life. As we felt new power flow in, as we enjoyed peace of mind, as we discovered we could face life successfully, as we became conscious of His presence, we began to lose our fear of today, tomorrow or the hereafter. We were reborn.</span></span></p>

But it is better to meet God alone than with one who might misunderstand. The wording was, of course, quite optional so long as we expressed the idea, voicing it without reservation.

	<span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore, we started upon a personal inventory.&nbsp;<i>This was Step Four.</i>&nbsp;A business which takes no regular inventory usually goes broke. Taking commercial inventory is a fact-finding and a fact-facing process. It is an effort to discover the truth about the stock-in-trade. One object is to disclose damaged or unsalable goods, to get rid of them promptly and without regret. If the owner of the business is to be successful, he cannot fool himself about values.</span></span></p>

	<span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;We did exactly the same thing with our lives. We took stock honestly.

	<span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Resentment is the &quot;number one&quot; offender. It destroys more alcoholics than anything else. From it stem all forms of spiritual disease, for we have been not only mentally and physically ill, we have been spiritually sick. When the spiritual malady is overcome, we straighten out mentally and physically. In dealing with resentments, we set them on paper. We listed people, institutions or principle with who we were angry. We asked ourselves why we were angry. In most cases it was found that our self-esteem, our pocketbooks, our ambitions, our personal relationships,</span></span></p>

For when harboring such feeling we shut ourselves off from the sunlight of the Spirit. The insanity of alcohol returns and we drink again. And with us, to drink is to die.</span></span></p>

	<span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;If we were to live, we had to be free of anger. The grouch and the brainstorm were not for us. They may be the dubious luxury of normal men, but for alcoholics these things are poison.</span></span></p>

	<span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;We turned back to the list, for it held the key to the future. We were prepared to look for it from an entirely different angle. We began to see that the world and its people really dominated us. In that state, the wrong-doing of others, fancied or real, had power to actually kill. How could we escape? We saw that these resentments must be mastered, but how? We could not wish them away any more than alcohol.</span></span></p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; ">
	<span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">This was our course: We realized that the people who wronged us were perhaps spiritually sick. </span></span></p>

	<span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">Though we did not like their symptoms and the way these disturbed us, they, like ourselves, were sick too. We asked God to help us show them the same tolerance, pity, and patience that we would cheerfully grant a sick friend. When a person offended we said to ourselves, &quot;This is a sick man. How can I be helpful to him? God save me from being angry. Thy will be done.&quot;</span></span></p>

	<span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;We avoid retaliation or argument. We wouldn&#39;t treat sick people that way. If we do, we destroy our chance of being helpful. We cannot be helpful to all people, but at least God will show us how to take a kindly and tolerant view of each and every one.</span></span></p>

	<span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Referring to our list again. Putting out of our minds the wrongs others had done, we resolutely looked for our own mistakes. Where had we been selfish, dishonest, self-seeking and frightened? Though a situation had not been entirely our fault, we tried to disregard the other person involved entirely. Where were we to blame? The inventory was ours, not the other man&#39;s. When we saw our faults we listed them. We placed them before us in black and white. We admitted our wrongs honestly and were willing to set these matters straight.</span></span></p>

	<span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Notice that the word &quot;fear&quot; is bracketed alongside the difficulties with Mr. Brown, Mrs. Jones, the employer, and the wife. This short word somehow touches about every aspect of our lives. It was an evil and corroding thread; the fabric of our existence was shot through with it. It set in motion trains of circumstances which brought us misfortune we felt we didn&#39;t deserve. But did not we, ourselves, set the ball rolling? Sometimes </span></span></p>

	<span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">we think fear ought to be classed with stealing. It seems to cause more trouble.</span></span></p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; ">
	<span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;We reviewed our fears thoroughly. We put them on paper, even though we had no resentment in connection with them. We asked ourselves why we had them. Wasn&#39;t it because self-reliance failed us? Self-reliance was good as far as it went, but it didn&#39;t go far enough. Some of us once had great self-confidence, but it didn&#39;t fully solve the fear problem, or any other. When it made us cocky, it was worse.</span></span></p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; ">
	<span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Perhaps there is a better way, we think so. For we are now on a different basis of trusting and relying upon God. We trust infinite God rather than our finite selves. We are in the world to play the role He assigns. Just to the extent that we do as we think He would have us, and humbly rely on Him, does He enable us to match calamity with serenity.</span></span></p>

	<span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;We never apologize to anyone for depending upon our Creator. We can laugh at those who think spirituality the way of weakness. Paradoxically, it is the way of strength. The verdict of the ages is that faith means courage. All men of faith have courage. They trust their God. We never apologize for God. Instead we let Him demonstrate, through us, what He can do. We ask Him to remove our fear and direct our attention to what He would have us be. At once, we commence to outgrow fear.</span></span></p>

But above all, we tried to be sensible on this question. It&#39;s so easy to get way off the track. Here we find human opinions running to extremes -- absurd extremes, perhaps.

They think we do not have enough of it, or that it isn&#39;t the right kind. They see its significance everywhere. One school would allow man no flavor for his fare and the other would have us all on a straight pepper diet. We want to stay out of this controversy. We do not want to be the arbiter of anyone&#39;s sex conduct. We all have sex problems. We&#39;d hardly be human if we didn&#39;t. What can we do about them?</span></p>

	<span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;We reviewed our own conduct over the years past. Where had we been selfish, dishonest, or inconsiderate? Whom had we hurt? Did we unjustifiably arouse jealousy, suspicion or bitterness? Where were we at fault, what should we have done instead? We got this all down on paper and looked at it.</span></span></p>

	<span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;In this way we tried to shape a sane and sound ideal for our future sex life. We subjected each relation to this test -was it selfish or not? We asked God to mold our ideals and help us to live up to them. We remembered always that our sex powers were God-given and therefore good, neither to be used lightly or selfishly nor to be despised and loathed.</span></span></p>

	<span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Whatever our ideal turns out to be, we must be willing to grow toward it. We must be willing to make amends where we have done harm, provided that we do not bring about still more harm in so doing. In other words, we treat sex as we would any other problem. In meditation, we ask God what we should do about each specific matter. The right answer will come, if we want it.</span></span></p>

Some people tell us so. But this is only a half-truth. It depends on us and on our motives. If we are sorry for what we have done, and have the honest desire to let God take us to better things, we believe we will be forgiven and will have learned our lesson. If we are not sorry, and our conduct continues to harm others, we are quite sure to drink. We are not theorizing. These are facts out of our experience.</span></span></p>

If sex is very troublesome, we throw ourselves the harder into helping others. We think of their needs and work for them. This takes us out of ourselves. It quiets the imperious urge, when to yield would mean heartache.</span></span></p>
