	<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">If we are painstaking about this phase of our development,&nbsp;<br />
	1. We will be amazed before we are half way through.&nbsp;<br />
	2. We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness.&nbsp;<br />
	3. We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it.&nbsp;<br />
	4. We will comprehend the word serenity and we will know peace.&nbsp;<br />
	5. No matter how far down the scale we have gone, we will see how&nbsp;our experience&nbsp;can benefit others.&nbsp;<br />
	6. That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear.&nbsp;<br />
	7. We will lose interest in selfish things and gain interest in our fellows.&nbsp;<br />
	8. Self-seeking will slip away.&nbsp;<br />
	9. Our whole&nbsp;attitude&nbsp;and outlook upon life will change.&nbsp;<br />
	10. Fear of people and of economic insecurity will leave us.&nbsp;<br />
	11. We will&nbsp;intuitively&nbsp;know how to handle situations which used to baffle us.&nbsp;<br />
	12. We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves&nbsp;(spiritual awakening).</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">
	<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">Are these extravagant promises? We think not. They are being&nbsp;fulfilled&nbsp;among us, sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly. They will always materialize if we work for them.</span></span></p>
